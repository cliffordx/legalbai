- **[13:09]** In the past months and weeks, the notifications from `SOSYAL MEDYAS` were deafening. I cannot complain, especially considering the recently concluded 2023 bar examinations, where I received valuable tips from Criminal Law professors on Facebook and stumbled upon a few helpful bar materials here and there. As I prepare to conquer the crucible of the bar exam in the upcoming 2024 bar examination, I am beginning to turn off those notifications and eliminate distractions. `Nagsugod na` ang ==the great alignment==.
