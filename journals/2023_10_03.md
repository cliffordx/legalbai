	- *From the syllabus:*
	- {{embed ((651b8d76-3625-4a6e-83ae-11312d2089e6))}}
	- So Article 1, e-memorize ni, if possible because mao ni foundation sa Family Code. Article 1 provides:
		- {{embed ((65179f14-cfe9-4c1c-be31-deb4c02f6165))}}
		- #### Aspects of marriage:
		  background-color:: yellow
		  collapsed:: true
			- ##### 1) it is a special contract
			  background-color:: green
			  collapsed:: true
				- Consequences of marriage are FIXED by law. ((65179eef-e17f-41db-a771-d011462fc4d5))
				  background-color:: red
					- {{embed ((65179eef-9c37-4a4f-ace0-2efdb3dca3aa))}}
					- DILI ma subject to stipulations. Maka affect sa property relations, or property rights.
						- > Later ato nya ni hisgotan regarding [marriage settlements.]([[marriage settlement]])
					- Kung pananglitan dunay contract nga mag-agree ang banag-asawa magkig-carnal knowledge sa lain party, subject diay na sa **disciplinary action**. That's according to *Biton v. Momongan,* 62 Phil. 7.[^1]
						- [^1]: _{Interesting case. Basahon bi.}
					- Naay balaod regarding matching Pinay for marriage to foreign nationals on a mail-order basis and other similar practices. Its R.A. No. 6955. You might want to [read that law.](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1990/06/13/republic-act-no-6955/)
			- ##### 2) it is a status
			  background-color:: blue
				- or relation or
				- an institution
				- Purpose of marriage is to establish conjugal and family life. Since marriage is a foundation of family and conjugal life, it is protected by the State.
					- Art. 15, sec 2, Constitution:
						- {{embed ((65179eff-1f6f-4b37-a721-2cf798f42186))}}
				- Kaning `status` mosignify ni sya parehas anang sa personal information sheet (PIS) nga fill-upan then naa diha: STATUS:  `Single`, `Married`, `Separated.`
					- Kay unsa diay na? That's a good question. Another good question related to #privacy is if it is considered as confidential personal information in contrast with just a personal information? So, accordingly this is only P.I ra ni not C.P.I. but if we're going to understand there are people who choose to be single but don't want to have a label on their PIS as such. Ngano kaha?
					- > When marriage ceremony ends (that is, the wedding ceremony), the marriage as a status begins. Mao naning time nga forever na ang contract, way bawi-ay, di na ibalik sa ginikanan. So be it.
				- **Question:** Do the words "MARRIED TO" preceding the name of a spouse prove co-ownership?[^6]
					- [^6] _{Sally Go-Bangayan v. Benjamin Bangayan Jr, 700 SCRA 702, G.R. No. 201061, July 3, 2013.}
					- *HELD:* **No.** The words "MARRIED TO" are merely descriptive of the civil status of the registered owner.
		- #### Principles:
		  collapsed:: true
			- it is a union (physical, etc.)
			- between man and a woman. This is monogamy which is the ideal marriage. Why? because it will have offspring and populate the whole world. (maytag mga tarong unta)
			- It is reciprocal. Pasabot ang banag-asawa, pari passu on equal footing. Ang bana dili e-opress ang asawa, ang asawa ayaw tawn mog e-under ang bana. Intawn, Do not HENPECK your husband.
			- Procreation. Para madaghan…. ang tarong. The natural moral law prohibits artificial birth control. For this is neither birth, nor control; not birth, for no children are born; not control for this would result only in excess and indulgence.^{Gilbert K. Chesterton.}[^4]
				- [^4]: _{p. 325, Paras Vol 1, 2021 ed.}
		- #### Distinguished from Other contracts
		  collapsed:: true
			- Ordinary contracts are mere contracts between parties while a contract of marriage is a social institution.
				- So it must be clear on my mind: Marriage is special and not ordinary contract.
			- In ordinary contracts ang agreements entered sa mga parties mag depend sa stipulation agreed into by the contracting parties unless those stipulations are against the law, public policy, public order, public morals, or good customs. In marriage, the nature and the consequences, as welll as incidents, are governed by law — except for cases of marriage settlements.
			- Therefore, as a general rule, stipulations on marriage other than the law are of no value.^{Paras, supra at p. 325.}
	- #### Article 2: Requisites of Marriage
		- {{embed ((65179f14-a416-47f9-b760-cf93dec7af07))}}
		- ### Legal Capacity
		  id:: 651bdc60-685c-406f-a7df-a6c21278b9f3
			- {{embed ((65179f14-5d04-4608-8549-e079e51de396))}}
			- (a) The parties must have the necessary age to enter into a marriage contract or there is a necessity to get consent from parents in certain cases. Why need man og consent from parents?
			  background-color:: pink
			  > Usually pinoy's tradition, and reason is that they don't want their child to get married without their "blessing."
				- ### Age in Contracts
				  background-color:: pink
					- For ordinary contracts, age of majority is now 18 years old. For marriage there is variance of age.
					- **Let's discuss this:**
						- Kung age 18 to 21 years old
						  background-color:: blue
							- `ang additional requirements are:` Parental **Consent** and marriage counseling.
						- Kung 22 to 25 years old
						  background-color:: green
							- `ang additional requirements are:` Parental **Advice** and [marriage counseling](((65179f14-e36a-49d4-a56d-7285fdeaec44))).
						- ==So ang difference is consent and advice.== Marriage counseling is the same between the age 18 to 25 years old.
						- ##### QUESTIONS:
						  background-color:: gray
							- What happen to age 25 years and above?
							- What happen to those adults who choose to get marriage late like in thier 40s or even 50s?
							- > These are just questions that I will come back later and understand. I will refer to this soon.
							- By process of elimination, we can now determine ani nga mga instances:
								- **Kung below 18 years old:** It's null and void even with consent of parents or guardians. ^{(Art. 35 (1), FC.)}
									- {{embed ((65179f14-acf2-47d3-a77a-5750ab131dc6))}}
					- {{embed ((65179f14-b85e-472f-9409-8c2601808da3))}}
					-
			- (b) there is NO impediment to marry. Meaning walay kabilinggan or dunay existing marriage or by certain relationships by affinity(law) or consanguinity (blood)^{RP v. Albios, 2013.}
			  background-color:: red
			  collapsed:: true
				- This include **consent**, I guess. In `Albios` case, which I digested in our Civil Rev class, mora silag nagduwa2x, marriage for convenience ang tawag. Morag marriage in jest. In fine, this is what the SC said:
				- > In ruling that Albios’ marriage was void for lack of consent, the CA characterized such as akin to a marriage by way of jest. A marriage in jest is a pretended marriage, legal in form but entered into as a joke, with no real intention of entering into the actual marriage status, and with a clear understanding that the parties would not be bound. The ceremony is not followed by any conduct indicating a purpose to enter into such a relation. It is a pretended marriage not intended to be real and with no intention to create any legal ties whatsoever, hence, the absence of any genuine consent. Marriages in jest are void ab initio, not for vitiated, defective, or unintelligent consent, but for a complete absence of consent. There is no genuine consent because the parties have absolutely no intention of being bound in any way or for any purpose.[^6]
					- [^6]: _{Supra, at 586. (Btw, CentralBook eSCRA is not intuitive unlike CDAsia. Anyhow, they both are just tools to amplify my "learnings.")}
					- In this case, their marriage is valid not that their marriage is lack of consent or their consent is vitiated but because marriage *only be declared void or voidable under the grounds provided by law,* and not marriage for convenience. In this scenario, ma-relate nato ang case WON (whether or not) dunay correlation sa katong [[mail-order bride]] under R.A. No. 6955.
					- The Court distinguished between a fraudulent or sham marriage, which is used for immigration purposes, and a non-subsisting marriage, which is one where the parties do not intend to live together as husband and wife. The Court stated that a fraudulent or sham marriage is still a marriage, albeit one that is subject to the State’s power to annul or declare it void. The Court cited various foreign jurisprudence that recognized the validity of marriages entered into for a limited purpose, such as gaining entry to a country, obtaining a visa, or avoiding military service.
					- **Rationale:**
						- Consent was not lacking between Albios and Fringer. In fact, there was real consent because it was not vitiated nor rendered defective by any vice of consent. Their consent was also conscious and intelligent as they understood the nature and the beneficial and inconvenient consequences of their marriage, as nothing impaired their ability to do so. ==That their consent was freely given is best evidenced by their conscious purpose of acquiring American citizenship through marriage. Such plainly demonstrates that they willingly and deliberately contracted the marriage.== There was a clear intention to enter into a real and valid marriage so as to fully comply with the requirements of an application for citizenship. There was a full and complete understanding of the legal tie that would be created between them, since it was that precise legal tie which was necessary to accomplish their goal.
- **[12:53]** Just a quick note about sharing content; I'm referring to law notes, reviewers, etc., that are available online.

	- To provide some context, [we live in a time](((636f5f5a-2e5f-40ab-983e-d02698e29c39))) where there is an abundance of information. I remember a few years ago, during my pre-law days, I struggled to find relevant law-related PDFs while studying Bachelor of Science in Real Estate Management. The information I found was often scarce or outdated. I always wanted to access the latest editions.
	- Shortly after beginning my legal education as law student, I came across numerous ebooks. In fact, the sheer volume of available options was overwhelming. However, instead of relying solely on digital copies, since I had the means and could afford physical books, I began collecting them. My personal law library now consists of over seventy (70) books across different authors.^{(some good authors, some bad authors, few worst authors)}
		- ![](../assets/law-book-collections.jpg){:height 649, :width 452}
			- ^{Fig. 1: My law book collections since first year in law school. By the way, not all books are in that shelf. This photo was taken last 2 August 2023.}
	- There was an occasion where I come across PDFs online that I find interesting and well-presented. If I like the content, I purchase a copy of the physical book for my own personal use. It's important to note that my intention is to use the physical book for my own consumption. I am aware of the implications of selling your own book, for example, only to find it later it was photocopied and shared online in digital format. That's one just example. There are other situations which I will share below.
	- Studies have shown that sharing pirated books negatively affects authors, as it infringes on their copyright. On the bright side, readers who come across pirated copies may choose to purchase the genuine book. I am one of them.
	  
	  > **SIDE NOTE:** While there are excellent law authors, there are also some who fall short. I have recommendations and opinions on how they can improve their work. For example, **they could provide readers with a way to provide feedback on typographical or grammatical errors or inform them about amendments to certain provisions**. This could be done through an erratum page or an addendum to the book. I have seen at least one "law content provider" doing this, but unfortunately, the ==almost all ignore such improvements and continue releasing updated versions with the same errors year after year==. Even minor details are sometimes left unchanged for many years. This issue is not exclusive to lesser-known authors, but even renowned ones like Reyes.[^2] I have encountered even worse cases, especially in Labor Law: compendiums by a Cebuano author with the ponencia by Justice Leonen, which are riddled with errors. *SUS! May ilabays basurahan.*
		- [^2]: _{*There was a provision regarding prescriptive period for the crime of Anti-Graft and Practices Act which was amended from* ~~10 15~~ *to 20 years, yet the 2021 edition of Book 2 is still 10 years! Di ba kadakong sayop nga naabot nalang 2021 wala pa maupdate. I won't call it disgusting but disappointing!*}
	- ### Copyright Infringement
		- I'm writing today because as I was scrolling through an FB group, I noticed an author asking who uploaded their work without his permission — a case for violation of his copyrighted work. The uploader even had her name on the GDrive, with her first, middle, and last name clearly displayed. It's obvious that ignorance is not an excuse in this case. She had her name on the GDrive complete with her first, middle and last name as the uploader.
			- ![](../assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 2.46.24 PM.png)
				- ^{Fig.2: Redacted for protection.}
		- Now, the author whose work was uploaded without permission has every right to be concerned and angry. Just weeks ago, this same author was saddened to find their work, which is meant for paid members only, being shared online for free. As law-abiding citizens, we should not tolerate this behavior.
		- But let's be honest, who among us can claim innocent? Someone might say, "I swear on my life, I have never downloaded or will never read any pirated law-related PDFs." But that's absolutely B.S., right? Pure B.S.[^3] That's another instance of [[cognitive dissonance]].
			- [^3]: _{Mao tong si BLD miingon kinsay may dili guilty, wa palang masakpi. Again, I will NOT condone illegal distribution of copyrighted materials, especially sa law. Naa nay nakasohan ani ug nakabayad ug penalty. Aside ani: Paksit ang reputasyon, kaluoy.}
		- ---
		- ***Now, why I am sharing this?***
			- *First:* the growing crowd of recognized review centers, independent reviewer centers, and independent teachers/reviewers is increasing. `Nagkadaghan, nagkaguli-yang.`
				- > NOTE: The recent `AI` faux paus with BLD/ Dizon is just an example. Sa bisaya pa "NAGPASIKAT" ang kug__.
			- *Second:* Because, while authors deserve our respect for their hard work in creating these PDFs, perhaps it's time for authors to step up and share legal knowledge at a higher and new dimension. Personally, I aspire to enter the publishing world and immortalize my learning in written form, such as by writing a book (or books) once I become a lawyer. (Or maybe I should not?)
			- The point is, I want to preserve my learning through text or words, just like what I'm doing here.
			  background-color:: green
				- > NOTE: Also, I provide free information like sharing my [github account](https://cliffordx.github.io/legalbai/) and download these `Logseq` graph and make your own notes just like what I did.
		- ### SUGGESTIONS/REQUESTS:
			- *I suggest for law authors the following:*
				- Improve your work and make it like a work of art.
				- Gather feedback in the form of errata page or addendum pdf sent to the email addresses of your buyers/subscribers.
				- With the exception of some well-known authors who provide free lectures and PDFs, which is highly commendable, consider sharing your knowledge freely and accepting criticism and admitting improvements.
			- *I admonish for law students or student of the law the following:*
				- Respect law authors. Do not share their work online without permission.
				- Show your respect and admiration for their work by purchasing their physical books.
				- - If you come across errors (let's call them `"poison"`), provide constructive criticism and inform the author respectfully. Maintain a positive attitude (paksitive) in your approach.
		- *What about you? What's your take?*
