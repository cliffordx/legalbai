	- ## Ranked Forecast of 2025 Civil Law Bar Topics
	  
	  (based solely on materials examinable up to 30 June 2024)
	  
	  The ranking below weighs (a) the 2025 Civil Law syllabus[7](https://www.scribd.com/document/772792487/2025-Civil-Law-Bar-Syllabus)[4](https://lexrex.ph/bar-exam-information/), (b) quantitative trends culled from the last ten examinations (2015-2024)[6](https://www.scribd.com/document/373600226/Pareto-Notes-General-Trend-in-Bar-Questions)[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf), and (c) the relative emphasis repeatedly given by the Supreme Court to recent statutes and doctrines that fall **within** the cut-off date.
	- ## 1 Obligations & Contracts  – Book IV (Very High Probability)
	- Consistently the single biggest slice of past exams—about 46 % of all Civil Law questions came from Book IV, 14 % of which focused on basic obligations[6](https://www.scribd.com/document/373600226/Pareto-Notes-General-Trend-in-Bar-Questions).
	- Most tested issues: fortuitous events, delay, breach remedies, novation, compensation, extinguishment, stipulation pour autrui, contract reformation, defective contracts[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
	- Expect practical scenarios on digital contracts and electronic evidence (still covered because the Civil Code rules remain the same).
	- ## 2 Family Relations under the Family Code  (Book I) (Very High)
	- 77 % of Book I questions in the last decade dealt with marriage validity, psychological incapacity, and property regimes[6](https://www.scribd.com/document/373600226/Pareto-Notes-General-Trend-in-Bar-Questions).
	- Likely angles:
		- Void vs. voidable marriages and consequences on property and filiation[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
		- Property relations (ACP, CPG, separation, effects of void unions)1[7](https://www.scribd.com/document/772792487/2025-Civil-Law-Bar-Syllabus).
		- Support, custody and the 2024 Rule on Family Mediation (A.M. No. 24-02-06-SC) which became effective before the cut-off[4](https://lexrex.ph/bar-exam-information/).
	- ## 3 Succession & Legitime (High)
		- Almost every recent exam carried at least one legitime-calculation or will-validity problem[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
		- Recurrent themes: compulsory heirs vs. testamentary dispositions, collation, preterition, advances, intestacy vs. testacy.
	- ## 4 Quasi-Delicts & Damages (High)
		- New SC rulings on medical negligence and employer liability in 2024 refresh this evergreen area1[18](https://jdadvising.com/which-subjects-tested-uniform-bar-exam/).
		- Bar frequently links Article 2176 actions with award of moral, exemplary and liquidated damages[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS).
	- ## 5 Property (Ownership, Co-ownership, Possession & Accession) (Moderate-High)
		- Questions on co-ownership sales, partition and legal redemption appeared in 2023-2024 sets[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
		- Land registration updates under R.A. 11573 (20-year possession) remain examinable because the law took effect in 2021[14](https://lawphil.net/courts/bm/barQ/barQs.html).
	- ## 6 Civil Register Corrections (R.A. 9048 / 10172 / 11909) (Moderate)
	- Administrative vs. judicial correction distinctions are a favorite short-essay staple1[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS).
	- R.A. 11909 (2022) adds permanent validity rules yet is inside the cut-off[7](https://www.scribd.com/document/772792487/2025-Civil-Law-Bar-Syllabus).
	- ## 7 Paternity, Filiation & Status of Children (Moderate)
	- R.A. 9255 surname issues, DNA evidence, and legitimacy after annulment remain bar mainstays[7](https://www.scribd.com/document/772792487/2025-Civil-Law-Bar-Syllabus)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
	- Foundling citizenship under R.A. 11767 (2022) may appear as a status/capacity nuance1[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
	- ## 8 Adoption – R.A. 11642 (Administrative Adoption) (Moderate)
	- The 2022 shift from judicial to administrative adoption is fresh but squarely within coverage[8](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bar-Bulletin-No-1-S-2024.pdf).
	- Expect qualification-of-adopter questions, foreign adopter rules, and effects of adoption on succession.
	- ## 9 Land Titles & Deeds; Prescription of Actions (Moderate)
	- Confirmation of imperfect title under R.A. 11573, prescription versus government, real vs. personal actions—tested repeatedly in 2019-2023[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf)[14](https://lawphil.net/courts/bm/barQ/barQs.html).
	- ## 10 Special Contracts:
	- Sale vs. Contract to Sell & Maceda Law
	- Real Estate Mortgage & Redemption
	- Donations (onerous vs. modal)
	  
	  (Moderate-Low)
	  
	  These appear regularly but in smaller numbers than core O&C items[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
	- ## 11 Persons – Juridical Capacity (Low-Moderate)
	- Acquisition of personality by natural and juridical persons, with attention to R.A. 11232’s one-person corporation provisions (still Civil-Law relevant only for personality issues)[4](https://lexrex.ph/bar-exam-information/)22.
	- ## 12 Conflict of Laws (Low)
	- Usual question: validity of foreign marriage/divorce and lex loci celebrationis vs. nationality principle—surfaced in 2023 exam[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
	- ## 13 Human Relations (Abuse of Rights, Unjust Enrichment) (Low)
	- Short conceptual questions occasionally asked; expect at most one item[7](https://www.scribd.com/document/772792487/2025-Civil-Law-Bar-Syllabus).
	  
	  ---
	- ## Study Strategy Pointers
	- Prioritize Obligations & Contracts and Family Code provisions—they historically generate the bulk of points[6](https://www.scribd.com/document/373600226/Pareto-Notes-General-Trend-in-Bar-Questions).
	- Master recent (≤ 30 June 2024) legislation affecting status—R.A. 11642, 11767, 11909, 11573—because they present “new yet examinable” scenarios1[14](https://lawphil.net/courts/bm/barQ/barQs.html).
	- Rehearse legitime computations and damages quantification; the bar repeatedly demands numerical answers[5](https://www.scribd.com/document/842286787/CIVIL-LAW-2024-BAR-Q-WITH-ANSWERS)[9](https://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Civil-Law.pdf).
