- **[11:09]** To date, there are [159 cases](https://github.com/cliffordx/MVLopez-FULL-CASES) that were decided by Justice M.V. Lopez that need to be digested. If I aim to complete one case digest per day, it would take me 159 days to finish. However, the actual time required could be less or more than 159 days depending on my daily pace. I may be able to complete more than one case digest per day, which would allow me to finish in less than 159 days.

	- Alternatively, there may be days where I am unable to complete even a single case digest, which would extend the overall time needed beyond 159 days. The final number of days will depend on how many case digests I am able to complete on average each working day.
