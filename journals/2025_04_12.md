- **[19:04:22]** Dying Declaration #mnemonic
	- To help you remember the four conditions of a dying declaration, an exception to the hearsay rule under [Rule 130, Section 38](((6447bbd3-2615-4c63-8d9b-9551a65cffdc))) of the Revised Rules on Evidence, I've created a mnemonic device designed to stick in your long-term memory. The conditions are:
		- The declaration must concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death.
		- At the time the declaration is made, the declarant is under a consciousness of an impending death.
		- The declarant would have been competent as a witness had he survived.
		- The declaration is offered in a criminal case, such as homicide, murder, or parricide, in which the declarant is a victim.
			- The mnemonic is: "The four C's: Cause, Conscious, Competent, Criminal."

				- Here’s how it works:
				- Cause: Represents the first condition. The declaration must be about the cause and circumstances of the declarant’s death—think of it as the "why" and "how" of their demise.
				- Conscious: Stands for the second condition. The declarant must be conscious of impending death when making the statement, believing their end is near, which adds truthfulness to their words.
				- Competent: Ties to the third condition. The declarant must have been competent to testify if they had lived, meaning they were of sound mind and capable of being a witness.
				- Criminal: Relates to the fourth condition. The declaration is used in a criminal case—like homicide, murder, or parricide—where the declarant is the victim.
				- #### Why This Works
				- Using "the four C's" leverages alliteration (all words start with C), making it catchy and easy to recall. Each "C" word directly connects to the core idea of its corresponding condition, reinforcing the meaning. To lock it in your memory, you can:
					- Repeat it: Say "Cause, Conscious, Competent, Criminal" out loud a few times.
					- Visualize: Picture a dying person pointing to their wound (Cause), nodding solemnly (Conscious), speaking clearly to a judge (Competent), and a police officer taking notes (Criminal).

					- This simple, memorable phrase—"the four C's"—should help you quickly recall the conditions whenever you need them!
