			- The determinant of how ranking works and how it relates to each school and to each student can be **very complex**. And a lot of hidden factors that I just surmised here that I did not know.
			- But one thing for certain: rankings do make people —
				- 1. judge another;
				  2. preconditioned or the mistaken belief on how to be become paksitful; or
				  3. that they are in the bet school.
