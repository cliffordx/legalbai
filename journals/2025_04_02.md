- **[14:26:59]** I am projecting that in the near (or far distant) future, Philippine judiciary (or Congress) will use `github-like` repository to manage public documents. It will be a game-changer.
- ### Review Materials
	- **[11:14:10]** Last January 2025, I availed UP BRIght Review Center's top-tiered review package. Alongside UP BRI, I also availed the full package offered from e-CODAL Plus. The latter is a supplement materials to the former.
		- These materials might propel me to pass the bar with high probability, but I did not take chances. I also availed Red-Gelo's 3-subject package for myself.
		- This acquisition of paid review materials could not have happen if I don't have the means and resources to buy them. This is a privilege that I cannot imagine years ago because I was then an A.S.P.O. â€” `anak sa pobreng ol*k.`
		- Anyway, I have to carry on and devour these "beasts."
