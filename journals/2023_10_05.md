	- My observation regarding the hashtag #BarniJlo2024
	- Take note there are two Justices in the Supreme Court of the Philippines who has surname Lopez. Aside from Mario V. Lopez (MVL) there is Jhosep Y Lopez (JYL).  Although most bar exam takers know that next year's bar is MVLopez, the `JLo` part could be Jhosep Lopez, but we know that's not the case because it refers to Justice Lopez (MVL) and not Jhosep Y Lopez (JYL). Just an observation and not a big deal. üòÅ
	- My only gripe is, "Why not make our own hastag?" `sagdi nalang.` Nana mana mga GC's mag su-on2x dayon.
