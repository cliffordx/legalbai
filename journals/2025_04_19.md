- **[23:15:49]** uploaded my `tldraw` notes for [[Special Writs]].
	- The note is unlike the native **Whiteboards** drawing where it was made inside this graph whereas this specific board (Special Writs) is just an `svg` file exported only from my local tldraw dev and pasted inside `Whiteboards.`
	- This is not optimal when viewed on the web because the svg file size is crazy heavy and huge (8Mb). Surely, using mobile devices to view this board will suffer.
		- > UPDATE: **[Sunday, April 20, 2025; 10:07:18]**
			- I deleted the board and transferred to [draw.io.](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=law-review-remedial.drawio&dark=auto#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcliffordx%2Flawdee%2Fmain%2Flaw-review-remedial.drawio)

					- A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another. (n)

				- ## 2. Failure to state a cause of action
					- #### Distinction:
						- Failure to state a cause of action refers to the **insufficiency of the allegations in the pleading**, while lack of cause of action refers to the **insufficiency of the factual basis for the action.**[^1]
						- [^1]: _{*Department of Public Works and Highways v. Manalo, G.R. No. 217656 (2020).*}
						- So, there is no failure when there is sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint or pleading.
							- [Sec. 6, Rule 110, ROC](((d742018d-7771-4ceb-9973-333925020408)))
								- A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense given by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed.
								- When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.

											  _A gang of clowns (wearing name tags so you know who they are) is gleefully throwing pies at a furious baker. This happens on a street with a big sign reading "Bakery Street", and in the background, there’s a calendar with March 14 (Pi Day) circled in red. Above the chaos, a giant headline on a billboard screams, "Clowns Charged with Stealing Pies!_
									- ***Here’s how this image maps to the six elements:***
									  collapsed:: true
										- Clowns: Represent the Accused. The gang of clowns implies multiple offenders, reminding you that all must be named if there’s more than one.
										- "Charged with Stealing Pies": This is the Designation of the offense, straight from the statute (think of it as the legal label for their crime).
										- Throwing pies: These are the Acts or omissions, the specific actions the clowns are accused of doing.
										- Baker: The Offended party, the poor victim covered in pie, clearly upset.
										- Pi Day (March 14): The Approximate date, a quirky, memorable date tied to pies (π = 3.14).
										- Bakery Street: The Place, a specific location where this pie-throwing crime went down.
									- ***Why It Works***
									  collapsed:: true
										- Absurdity: Clowns hurling pies at a baker is ridiculous and funny, making it stick in your mind.
										- Relatable Objects: Clowns, pies, a baker, a street sign, and a calendar are familiar but exaggerated here for effect.
										- Cohesive Story: The elements connect logically—clowns commit a pie-related crime against a baker at a specific time and place, with a clear charge.
										- No Strict Order: You don’t need to memorize a sequence; just picture the scene, and all six pieces fall into place.
									- **How to Use It**
									  collapsed:: true
										- When you need to recall the elements, visualize this scene: the clowns (Accused) throwing pies (Acts) at the baker (Offended) on Bakery Street (Place) on Pi Day (Date), charged with stealing pies (Designation). The image naturally prompts all six requirements.
									- ***Quick Recap with the Image***
									  collapsed:: true
										- Who’s accused? The clowns (Accused, multiple named).
										- What’s the charge? Stealing pies (Designation).
										- What did they do? Threw pies (Acts).
										- Who’s hurt? The baker (Offended).
										- When? Pi Day (Date).
										- Where? Bakery Street (Place).
					- #### Failure to state a cause of action
					  background-color:: yellow
						- must be filed at the earliest stage or before a responsive pleading is filed
						- immaterial if the allegation is true or false
						- preliminary objections raised by the defendant
					- #### Lack of cause of action
					  background-color:: red
						- Filed after the plaintiff rested its case
						- the judge shall determine the truth and falsity based on the evidence presented
						- raised as demurrer to evidence as a ground for insufficient of evidence
