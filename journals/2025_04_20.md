- Easter Sunday
- **[11:00:43]** Is the TV series [Better Call Saul]([[legal advice]]) worth watching? [I guess so](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_4ab9972e-2613-4917-8449-85b49e9738df).
	- After the `Breaking Bad` series, I did watch `Better Call Saul` but not the entire season of season 1. I am sure it's only few episodes and this was waaay before I enrolled and studied law.
	- This is around 2015ish. I enrolled at USJ-R School of Law around second semester of 2019 with only two (2) subjects: *Legal Ethics and Basic Logic(?).*
	- Ok. **[11:08:45]** Now re-watching Season 1, Episode 1: `"UNO"`
