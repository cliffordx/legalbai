	- ### Outlined summary of the video (via PPLX)
	- **Bar Review: Unions, Unfair Labor Practices, Collective Bargaining, and Strikes — Key Takeaways for Bar Exams**
	- **Constitutional Basis**: The right to self-organization, collective bargaining, and striking is enshrined in the Philippine Constitution and serves as the foundation for labor laws regarding unions and labor relations.
	- **Who Can Join a Union?**
		- All workers have the right to join and form labor organizations, but only *rank-and-file employees* can form or join unions for collective bargaining purposes.
		- Managers, confidential employees, and supervisory employees are disqualified from joining rank-and-file unions or participating in collective bargaining for rank-and-file employees.
		- Supervisors may form their own unions separate from rank-and-file.
	- **Rights Granted under the Constitution and Labor Code:**
		- Right to self-organization — workers may form/join unions for mutual aid and protection.
		- Right to collective bargaining — unions negotiate with employers for better terms & conditions of employment.
		- Right to strike — as a means of redress for labor grievances.
		- Right to participate in policy/decision-making processes relevant to labor organizations.
	- **Unfair Labor Practices (ULP)**
		- Both employer and union may commit ULPs.
		- ULPs include interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights or dominating union activities.
		- Committing a ULP is both a civil and criminal offense.
	- **Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)**
		- Only the *exclusive bargaining agent* (certified union) can negotiate a CBA with management.
		- The CBA governs wages, hours, and working conditions.
		- Certification election determines which union acts as the sole bargaining agent.
	- **Strike and Lockout**
		- Strikes must follow lawful procedure: notice, cooling-off period, mandatory mediation.
		- Grounds for strike: ULPs or deadlock in CBA negotiations.
		- Government may assume jurisdiction in strikes affecting national interest, and can order work resumption.
		- Hospitals and essential services face special limitations regarding strikes.
	- **Certification Election & Union Registration**
		- A union must register with the DOLE to acquire legal personality.
		- Certification election determines the exclusive bargaining agent. All eligible members in the bargaining unit may vote.
		- Only registered unions may petition for, or participate in, certification elections.
	- **Union Dues and Membership**
		- Only regular employees as of signing the CBA can be part of the bargaining unit.
		- Payment of union dues is required for union membership; exceptions are provided for religious belief.
	- **Rights and Obligations of Union Members**
		- Right to participate in union meetings and decision-making, elect union officials, be informed of union affairs.
		- Obligation to participate in union activities and respect CBA terms.
	- **Limitations**
		- Limitations on union formation for government employees, managerial, confidential staff, and cooperative members (generally restricted or outright excluded).
		- Homogeneity rule: Appropriate bargaining units must be composed of workers with similar interests to ensure effectiveness in representation.
	- **Remedies and Enforcement**
		- Strike, CBA grievance mechanisms, NLRC, and direct intervention by the Secretary of Labor in instances where necessary for industrial peace.
		  
		  These summarized **key concepts often form the basis of bar exam questions** related to labor law topics such as union rights, processes, legal restrictions, and remedies. This summary prioritizes constitutional foundations, procedures, limitations, and actionable points — all critical for both multiple-choice and essay-type questions in the bar examination.
