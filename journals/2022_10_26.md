**[16:46]**  After the dust has cleared[^1] I figured, I no longer need `public:: true.`

	- I set this [[graph]]  settings to `all pages` to `true`
	- > NOTE: I have two graphs (so far!). One internal which contains thousands of files and this one (limited publish) for external (for the world.)
	- [^1]: _{When you have so many things in your mind, you can't think clearly.}
- Test publish
	- made a mirror post here coz setting is set `not to set public when published.` I have to manually set the properties to `public:: true` each new block.
