- **[18:59:04]** My source of latest information and pastime a.k.a distractions are:
	- reading non-law books
	- X (formerly Twitter)
	- Youtube
	- Discord channel (about the 2025 bar)
	- Facebook groups, if I open them via desktop browser only.
	- Days remaining until the D-DAY or the bar exam day is 353 days left. So make the most of my time and read, read, and read. Read #Amying4Excellence Jurisprudence.
