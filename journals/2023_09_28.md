## Suggested Answer in Question No. 8 (2023 Civil Law Bar Exam)
	- **Q\#8** Niccolo and his girlfriend Meann were classmates in medical school. When they finished their studies and started earning, they decided to invest in a condominium unit together which they hoped to lease out. Since Niccolo came from a rich family and was still receiving an allowance from his parents, the couple decided that Niccolo would shell out 2/3 (P10 million) of the P15 million purchase price, while Meann would contribute 1/3 (P5 million). They asked a mutual friend who was a law student to draw up a contract which reflected the mentioned interests. The contract also had a provision that their shares in the benefits as well as the charges affecting the property would be equal. They then found a long-term tenant who rented the property for P30,000 a month. Unfortunately, Niccolo and Meann broke up and are now quarreling over their respective shares in the rental income. Niccolo insists that he should get P20,000 or 2/3 of the monthly income while Meann claims that it should be P15,000 each.

		- **SUGGESTED ANSWER:**
			- Niccolo is  correct. According to [Article 485](((6300756e-0af8-4600-be53-6d031164f43b))) of the New Civil Code, the share of the co-owners, in the benefits as well as in the charges, shall be proportional to their respective interests. Any stipulation in a contract to the contrary shall be void. The portions belonging to the co-owners in the co-ownership shall be presumed equal, unless the contrary is proved.
			- In this case, Niccolo and Meann are co-owners of the condominium unit, which they bought together for P15 million. Niccolo contributed 2/3 (P10 million) of the purchase price, while Meann contributed 1/3 (P5 million). Therefore, their respective interests in the co-ownership are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. This means that they should also share the benefits and charges affecting the property in the same proportion, unless they can prove otherwise.
			- The contract that they asked their mutual friend to draw up had a provision that their shares in the benefits as well as the charges affecting the property would be equal is VOID. This is a stipulation that is contrary to Article 485 of the Civil Code, and therefore, it is void. The contract cannot change the legal consequences of their co-ownership, which are based on their actual contributions. The contract also cannot override the presumption of equality of shares, which can only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.
			- Therefore, Niccolo and Meann should share the rental income of P30,000 a month according to their respective interests, which are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. This means that Niccolo should get P20,000, while Meann should get P10,000. Meann's claim that it should be P15,000 each is incorrect, because it is based on a void stipulation in the contract. Niccolo's claim that he should get P20,000 is correct, but not because of the contract, but because of the law.
