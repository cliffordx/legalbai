- **[12:07:12]** This is my unfiltered, "unbiased" opinion on this current Impeachment ruling crisis. First, a disclaimer. I'm a law student and I am protected with my freedom of speech and freedom of expression within the bounds of 1987 Constitution. Having said that, another disclaimer, I will write no matter how I say it without modification from LLMs. Now, let's go to what I think and what I need to express.
	- TL;DR. The SC is right, and since not all agree, let's just say that, we can agree to disagree but do not resort to being "Bad Rudi" if that makes sense.
	- The crux of the issue is the first set of complaints filed by three individual or separate entities. This is NOT about filing and referred to the Committee, this is about those 3.
