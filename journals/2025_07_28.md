- **[12:07:12]** This is my unfiltered, grammarly incorrect but "unbiased" opinion on this current impeachment ruling crisis. First, a disclaimer. I'm a law student and I am protected with my freedom of speech and freedom of expression within the bounds of 1987 Constitution. Having said that, another disclaimer, I will write this no matter how I say it without any aid or modification from LLMs or AI. Now, let's proceed.
	- **TL;DR.** The SC is right to conclude where 13-0 is in favor of declaring the impeachment filed against VP Sara Z. Duterte unconstitutional for not following due process under Article XI of the Constitution. Since not all agree with the decision, let's just say that, we can agree to disagree but do not resort to being "Bad Rudi." If that makes sense why I brought up "Bad Rudi"  in my post. (He curses a lot, with tagalog pa P..I..)
	- The crux of the issue is the first set of complaints filed by three individuals or 3 separate persons. This is NOT about filing and referral to the Committee but about the 3 previous complaints leading to the 4th complaint. Those against the  SCruling does not expound what happened prior to the fourth (4th) complaint. The session days, the required 10 session days under the Constitution, I don't know what happen during those deliberation, the archiving, etc.
	- The issue is in those first 3 complaints. Is due process compiled?
	- Is that counted as part of the initiation in the impeachment process?
	- Because SC held that when the session is terminated and archived, it is deemed dismissed that bar the filing of subsequent complaint which is the fourth. This is the trigger point, the crux of the matter.
	- For me the element of filing and referral exist in those 3 complaints. This make sense and logical if you think about it.
	- However, naay however.
	- It's like a two-edged sword. It can be seen as judicial overrreach. The funny part is that only SC can interpret and uphold the Constitution. And that is so because who will be? A Congressman, Senator, a lawyer-turned-vlogger on Youtube?
	- It's true the power emanates from the people. The people are supreme. But ultimately, we need the rule of law. A just law. The Supreme Court is not infallible but they are supreme. That's 13-0.
	- Now, for some devil's advocate perspective.
	- I don't agree with some of the Supreme Court's ruling but not on this particular case.
	- Thank you for your attention on this matter.
