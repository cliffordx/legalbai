- **[12:07:12]** This is my unfiltered, grammarly incorrect but "unbiased" opinion on this current impeachment ruling crisis. First, a disclaimer. I'm a law student and I am protected with my freedom of speech and freedom of expression within the bounds of 1987 Constitution. Having said that, another disclaimer, I will write this no matter how I say it without any aid or modification from LLMs or AI. Now, let's proceed.
	- **TL;DR.** The SC is right to conclude where 13-0 is in favor of declaring the impeachment filed against VP Sara Z. Duterte is unconstitutional for not following due process under Article XI of the 1987 Constitution. Since not all agree, let's just say that, we can agree to disagree but do not resort to being "Bad Rudi" if that makes sense.
	- The crux of the issue is the first set of complaints filed by three individuals or separate entities. This is NOT about filing and referral to the Committee, this is about those 3 previous complaints. Those against the ruling does not expound what happened prior to the fourth (4th) complaint. The session days, the required 10 session days under the 1987 Constitution, I don't know what happen during those deliberation, the archiving, etc.
	- That is the issue. Is that due process?
	- Is that counted as part of the initiation in the impeachment process?
	- Because SC held that it when it is terminated and archived, it is deemed dismiss that bar the filing of subsequent complaint which is the fourth. For me, this make sense and logical.
	- However, naay however.
	- It's like a two-edged sword. It can be seen as judicial overrreach. The funny part is that only SC can interpret and uphold the Constitution. And that is so because who will be? Any Congressman, a lawyer on Youtube?
	- It's true the power emanates from the people. The people are supreme. But ultimately, we need the rule of law. A just law.
	- Now, for some devil's advocate perspective.
	- I don't agree with some of the Supreme Court's ruling. Not on this case.
	- Thank you for your attention on this matter.
