- ## Index Card as Zettelkasten
- Today, I received 15 sets of 100 sheets of white ruled index cards  with dimension of 4" x 6". Two (2) days ago I also received the same except  that it was six (6) sets of different color of index cards.
- ## What is Zettelkasten?
- A Zettelkasten is a system for taking notes and storing ideas. It is named after the German word for "slip box," which is a type of filing system. The Zettelkasten method was developed by German sociologist and historian Niklas Luhmann and has been gaining popularity in recent years.
- The basic idea behind a Zettelkasten is that you store your ideas in a central location, where they are easy to find and retrieve. Each idea is represented by a "zettel," or note card. These notes are then organized into folders, or "kasten."
- You can use a Zettelkasten for anything from taking class notes to writing a book. The system is designed to help you make connections between ideas, so you can easily find and retrieve information when you need it.
- If you're interested in trying out a Zettelkasten, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you'll need to decide how you want to take and store your notes. You can use physical note cards, or you can create a digital Zettelkasten using a software program like Evernote or OneNote. Today, I personally use Logseq along with Obsidian. (More on that on later posts.)
- Second, you'll need to decide how you want to organize your notes. You can do this by subject, by project, or by any other method that makes sense to you.
- Finally, you'll need to decide how you want to use your Zettelkasten. You can use it as a simple filing system, or you can use it to help you brainstorm new ideas or plan projects.
- No matter how you use it, a Zettelkasten can be a helpful tool for organizing and retrieving information.
## How to make note-taking an effective learning strategy
- Note-taking is a strategy for making information **meaningful**.
- Research reveals the main value of note-taking is through **its effect on how you encode the information in your brain.**
- That is, the act of note-taking is more important than the result.
- For this reason, note-taking is effective to the extent that you **paraphrase, organize** and **make sense of the information** while taking notes[^1] â€” in other words, to the extent that you put the information in your own words. #nts
