- ## SEC. 17. Corporate Name.

	- A name is not distinguishable even if it contains one or more of the following:
		- (a) The word “corporation”, “company”, “incorporated”, “limited”, “limited liability”, or an abbreviation of one of such words; and
		- (b) Punctuations, articles, conjunctions, contractions, prepositions, abbreviations, different tenses, spacing, or number of the same word or phrase.
		- The Commission, upon determination that the corporate name is: (1) not distinguishable from a name already reserved or registered for the use of another corporation; (2) already protected by law; or (3) contrary to law, rules and regulations, may summarily order the corporation to immediately cease and desist from using such name and require the corporation to register a new one.

- ## SEC. 18. Registration, Incorporation and Commencement of Corporate Existence.
	- A person or group of persons desiring to incorporate shall submit the intended corporate name to the Commission for verification.

	- A delinquent corporation shall have a period of two (2) years to resume operations and comply with all requirements that the Commission shall prescribe.
