- # Welcome to Legal Bai

	- This is [Clifford Enoc's]([[Clifford Enoc]]) repository of law notes, [codal annotations]([[codal]]) and commentaries in my study of law in the Philippines. As of writing this welcome/index page [28 July 2022], I am in my third year of law school.

	- You can collapse or expand headings to show or hide subgroups. Next to the title `What can you expect from my GitHub page`, there is a `.` on the left. **Do not click on it yet, as it will open a separate page.** If you hover over it, you will see a drop-down arrow, depending on whether the page is hidden or already shown. **Try it out!**
	- Next, there are left and right side menu bars. **Explore them and let me know if you find anything interesting.** ;)

- ### What can you expect from my Github page?
  id:: 635bc75b-257f-4fc4-b4f3-8dece2332ef7
  collapsed:: true
	- A lot. For starters, I have created and collected #[[flashcards]] from exams and quizzes.
	- I have also uploaded the fundamental codals here, with [my]([[Clifford Enoc]]) annotations and comments, as well as some from law book authors.
		- ~~But don't expect too much. Some are not meant to be shared.~~
			- ~~Reason: Some are from authors of a law book.~~
				- Others are from law review pdfs floating around but it's already there,  no need to have it here.

	- Since I am taking a hybrid/multi-faceted approach to learning, my overarching goal is to write my own words and thoughts about what I have studied and learned so far, here on Github.
	- My original plan was to consolidate everything on my website (CliffordX.com), but I opted to publish here instead. This way, I only need to commit the pages I’ve written in my PKM app ([[Logseq]], FTW!) from my laptop, and they will be updated and displayed here [instantly.]([[publishing]])
	- **It makes my workflow much easier.**
	- I do have handwritten outlines, notes on a 4"x6" [index card]([[Index_Cards]]) which I already plan to write simultaneously or concurrently with my typewritten notes here. I plan to upload also those handwritten notes if it so required. (But I'm busy, [here's my lazy alibi](((6803b206-4fa3-4d86-b40b-3cdb412a2b2b))))
