			- ## Agency coupled with an interest.
			- Article 1927 mentions three instances of irrevocability. Fourth is found in ((634fba6e-255a-4712-962d-0b491d39ff55))
			- The general rule is that the principal may revoke an agency at will. (Art. 1920.) The rationale for the rule is that the essence of agency is the agent‚Äôs duty of obedience to the principal. This rule, however, has exceptions and they are:
				- (1) when the agency is created not only for the interest of the principal but also for the interest of third persons; and (just cause: read ((634fba63-c3ca-451a-b965-2e764f6470c0)))
				- (2) when the agency is created for the mutual interest of both the principal and the agent. (Art. 1930.)
			- In either case, the agency is deemed as one coupled with an interest. It becomes part of another obligation or agreement. It is evident that the agency cannot be revoked by the sole will of the principal as long as the interest of the agent or of a third person subsists because it is not solely the rights of the principal which are affected.
			- However, an irrevocable power of attorney is obligatory only on the principal who executed the agency. It cannot affect one who is not a party thereto.[^1]

		- The agent may withdraw from the agency by giving due notice to the principal. If the latter should suffer any damage by reason of the withdrawal, the agent must indemnify him therefor, unless the agent should base his withdrawal upon the impossibility of continuing the performance of the agency without grave detriment to himself.
