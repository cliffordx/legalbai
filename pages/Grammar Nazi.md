- Here's the thing. When I publish my [[graph]] here, sometimes or often there are typos, that's a given and I sometimes missed it but mostly I double check but you can't be sure.
- If you can help me out, thank you. You can [reach me here](((de1311b9-7141-4a55-950c-2ffe17d350c0))) or send an email to `cresupport@gmail.com.`
- Mistakes and wrong grammar are so annoying, right? I can relate because I also get annoyed, but when it comes to my own writing? Haha, I'm terrible at it.
- So help me make me a better "grammar nazi," deal?
- Below is a screenshot of what I learned when you are reading critically. It is not a typo (though there are lot throughout the book) but an [anthropomorphism](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/anthropomorphism) where the animals were interchanged. (*Read* [Explanation: The Hedgehog and the Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox))
- I'm not bashing the author; the errors may have crept in during the publishing process or the editor may have lacked time or resources to thoroughly proofread the book.

- iIf you happen to have or want to know which book is this, it's from the book, "**Forester of Nations The Last Resort"** page 65 of **Chapter Two**: *From The Groves of Academe To the Corridors of Power*.
- It's a good book I really recommend it but a little bit pricey.
- There are typos throughout the book but I can live with it. How about you? So there's that.
- Thanks for reading. â€” *Paksiteer*
