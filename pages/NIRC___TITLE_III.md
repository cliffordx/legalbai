			- **[20:51]** #ai/chatgpt/law Section 85 of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines discusses the gross estate of a decedent, which is the total value of their assets and properties at the time of their death. Subsection (B) of this section specifically deals with transfers made in contemplation of death, which may be subject to taxation.
			  collapsed:: true
				- The provision states that any transfer made by the decedent, either through a trust or in any other way, with the intention that the transfer will take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after their death, will be included in the gross estate. This means that the value of any such transferred interest will be subject to estate tax.
				- Furthermore, the provision also includes transfers made by the decedent under which they retained certain rights or interests in the property, such as the right to possess or enjoy the property, the right to the income from the property, or the right to designate the person who will possess or enjoy the property or its income. These types of transfers are also subject to estate tax, except in the case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.
				- In summary, this provision aims to prevent individuals from avoiding estate taxes by transferring their assets or properties to others in contemplation of their death. The provision ensures that such transfers are subject to estate tax, thereby maintaining the integrity of the Philippine tax system
			- #PROMPT How can I determine if a transfer is bona fide or not?
				- #ai/bing According to the web search results, a bona fide sale is a sale that is made in good faith and for an adequate and full consideration¹³. Consideration means the price or value given for the property transferred³. A sale is not bona fide if it is made with the intent to evade estate tax or if it is not supported by sufficient evidence¹³.
				- Some factors that may indicate a bona fide sale are:
				  collapsed:: true
					- (a) the transferor and transferee are not related;
					- (b) the transferor does not retain any interest or control over the property or its income;
					- (c) the transferor receives a fair market value for the property;
					- (d) the transferor and transferee have independent legal representation;
					- (e) the transfer is properly documented and reported³.
