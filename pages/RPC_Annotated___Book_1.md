			- This is the answer to the question: **How does one prove self-defense in court?**
				- #ai/bing In order for an accused person to successfully invoke self-defense as a justifying circumstance in court, they must be able to prove the following elements:
					- Unlawful aggression: There must have been a real and imminent threat to the life or safety of the accused. This means that the accused must have been facing an attack or a threat of attack that put them in immediate danger.
					- Reasonable necessity of the means employed: The means used by the accused to defend themselves must have been reasonable and proportionate to the threat they were facing. This means that they should not have used excessive force in defending themselves.
					- Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself: The accused must not have provoked or instigated the attack in any way.
					- The burden of proof lies with the accused to establish these elements by clear and convincing evidence. If they are able to do so, then they will be acquitted of the charge because their actions were justified under the law.
