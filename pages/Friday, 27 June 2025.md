		- I think I'm on the right track.
		- 4 hours per day starting -60 days to DAY-D.
		- I mirror my circadian time intended for the bar exam time slot. I will sleep early at 9am. Wake up at 4am.
		- *Pomodoro technique.*
		- Good for most, but I learned it's not for me. My mind wonder a lot so I forced myself to focus uninterrupted as long as I can. Let's say, I fix it at 10 minutes or at most 3 hours and if my mind wonder or cannot understand anymore, or distracted, just reset the time. I learned this from Huberman podcast.
		- Currently, working at 3 hours uninterrupted and 25 minutes break. So for the whole day, 6 hours of study, I think, is good enough.
- ## Highlights of the Latest Labor Law Amendments (2023–2024)
- ### **1. Gig Economy and Employer-Employee Relationship**
	- **Borromeo v. Lazada (G.R. No. 265610, April 2, 2024):** The Supreme Court clarified the application of the four-fold test and the economic reality test in determining employer-employee relationships, especially for gig economy workers like delivery riders. The Court emphasized that contractual labels (e.g., "independent contractor") do not control; actual control and economic dependence are determinative. This ruling has broad implications for all non-traditional work arrangements, including those involving TV broadcasters and other freelancers[1].
- ### **2. Migrant Workers and Recruitment Regulation**
	- **R.A. No. 11641 (Department of Migrant Workers Act):** Established the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW), consolidating the POEA and other agencies. The DMW is tasked with protecting OFWs, regulating recruitment, and providing reintegration programs. The law stresses that overseas work should be a choice, not a necessity, and the State does not promote it as a primary economic strategy[1].
- **R.A. No. 8042 (as amended by R.A. No. 10022):** Remains crucial for illegal recruitment definitions, penalties (especially for large-scale and syndicated cases), and solidary liability of local agencies and foreign employers. The DMW now has enhanced powers to combat illegal recruitment[1].
	- **D.O. No. 221-2021:** Updated rules for Alien Employment Permits (AEP), specifying requirements for foreign nationals working in the Philippines[1].
- ### **3. Strengthened DOLE Enforcement Powers**
	- **D.O. No. 238-23 (April 2023):** Reinforces the DOLE Secretary’s visitorial and enforcement powers under Article 128 of the Labor Code and R.A. No. 11058 (OSH Law). Key features:
		- Expanded labor inspections (including OSH investigations).
		- Technical and advisory visits for micro-establishments.
		- Power to issue compliance orders and work stoppage orders for imminent danger.
		- Employers must keep employment records for at least three years[1].
	- **D.O. No. 242-24 (February 2024):** Implements R.A. No. 11360, mandating 100% distribution of service charges to rank-and-file employees (excluding managers), at least twice a month, with transparency and record-keeping requirements[1].
- ### **4. Innovations in Labor Standards**
	- **Telecommuting Act (R.A. No. 11165):** Institutionalizes telecommuting as a voluntary arrangement. Telecommuting employees must receive benefits and rights equal to their on-site counterparts, including pay, workload, rest periods, and collective rights. Employers must ensure data privacy and provide written terms of telecommuting programs[1].
	- **Expanded Maternity Leave (R.A. No. 11210):** Grants 105 days of paid maternity leave for live births (plus 15 days for solo parents), 60 days for miscarriage/stillbirth, and allows up to 7 days to be allocated to the father or alternate caregiver. Applies regardless of civil status or frequency of pregnancy[1].
	- **Safe Spaces Act (R.A. No. 11313, Article IV):** Expands the definition of workplace sexual harassment to include any unwelcome sexual actions or remarks by anyone in the workplace, not just those with authority. Employers must create a Code of Conduct, establish a Committee on Decorum and Investigation (CODI), and provide safe reporting mechanisms. Failure to comply leads to employer liability[1].
- ### **5. Mental Health in the Workplace**
	- **Labor Advisory No. 19, s. 2023:** Requires employers to provide access to mental health services, accommodations (e.g., flexible work, additional leave), and confidentiality of medical records. Employers must submit annual reports to DOLE on mental health cases and activities[1].
- ### **6. Public Sector Unionism**
	- **2024 Rules on Government Employees’ Right to Organize:** Updates the framework for public sector unionism, clarifying registration of national employees’ organizations, procedures for collective negotiation agreements (CNAs), and dispute resolution. Broadens the scope of negotiable matters beyond economic benefits to include welfare, safety, and career development. Emphasizes conciliation and mediation for disputes[1].
- ### **7. Judicial Reforms in Labor Dispute Resolution**
	- **Supreme Court Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations (SPJI) 2022–2027:** Aims to make labor dispute resolution more efficient, transparent, inclusive, and technologically adaptive. Key reforms include:
		- Faster case disposition and expanded use of mediation/ADR.
		- Digitization of court processes and promotion of online dispute resolution.
		- Enhanced access for vulnerable workers through simplified procedures and legal aid[1].

	- Mastery of the interplay between new and existing laws, as well as recent Supreme Court rulings, is essential for the 2025 Bar[1].
