		- Object of the motion - the MR referred in this Rule is one that is directed against a judgment or a final order. It is not MR of an **[[Interlocutory Order]]** which normally precedes a petition for certiorari under [[Rule 65]].
	- Within the same period, the aggrieved party may also move for reconsideration upon the grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law.
