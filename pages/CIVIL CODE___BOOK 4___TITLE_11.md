	- **ARTICLE 1933.**
	  id:: 4052a899-4185-4bde-97f8-718f7b3a8694
		- By the [contract of loan]([[Contract of Loan]]), one of the parties delivers to another, either something not consumable so that the latter may use the same for a certain time and return it, in which case the contract is called a *[[commodatum]]*; or money or other consumable thing, upon the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be paid, in which case the contract is simply called a loan or *[mutuum]([[Mutuum]])*.
		- *Commodatum* is essentially gratuitous.
		- Simple loan may be gratuitous or with a stipulation to pay interest.
		- In *commodatum* the [bailor](((62f9c069-42cb-4092-9224-891a88762022))) retains the ownership of the thing loaned, while in simple loan, ownership passes to the borrower. (1740a)

		- An accepted promise to deliver something by way of *commodatum* or simple loan is binding upon the parties, but the *commodatum* or simple loan itself shall not be perfected until the delivery of the object of the contract. (n)

	- ## SECTION 1 - Nature of Commodatum
		- **ARTICLE 1935.**
			- The bailee in commodatum acquires the use of the thing loaned but not its fruits; if any compensation is to be paid by him who acquires the use, the contract ceases to be a commodatum. (1941a)
		- **ARTICLE 1936.**

		- **ARTICLE 1938.**
			- The bailor in commodatum need not be the owner of the thing loaned. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1939.**
			- Commodatum is purely personal in character. Consequently:
				- (1) The death of either the bailor or the bailee extinguishes the contract;
				- (2) The bailee can neither lend nor lease the object of the contract to a third person. However, the members of the baileeâ€™s household may make use of the thing loaned, unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, or unless the nature of the thing forbids such use. (n)

				- (2) If he keeps it longer than the period stipulated, or after the accomplishment of the use for which the commodatum has been constituted;
				- (3) If the thing loaned has been delivered with appraisal of its value, unless there is a stipulation exempting the bailee from responsibility in case of a fortuitous event;
				- (4) If he lends or leases the thing to a third person, who is not a member of his household;
				- (5) If, being able to save either the thing borrowed or his own thing, he chose to save the latter. (1744a

				- (2) If the use of the thing is merely tolerated by the owner. (1750a)
		- **ARTICLE 1948.**
			- The bailor may demand the immediate return of the thing if the bailee commits any act of ingratitude specified in [article 765](((c0f49720-d586-4472-95ae-8a39ef960e57))). (n)
