- Official Website: https://obsidian.md
- Their tagline:
- > A second brain, 
   for you, forever.
	- >Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base
	  that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
- ... is impressive.
- When I use this app last year (around May 2021), it was my first delve of what PKM is and interconnecting my notes with other similar, related notes. Well, let's just say, apart from Google Notes, Evernotes and I did free trial on Notion, I feel in loved with Obsidian because of its open-source plain markdown files.You have your data on your machine, i.e., your laptop.
- But things got a bit of U-turn (well, I did not abandon Obsidian, I pay for it to become an Insider), and then I was introduced to [[logseq]] and that is why this site you are reading now comes into being.
- Any other technology, just like this one is just a tool, an extension of ourselves yet it still boils down how you manage information.
- But I find this space really, really interesting. In fact, I'm active in [[logseq]] community on Discord.
	- Right now, I'm looking forward to a collaborative feature which is the next-generation feature in the PKM space happening very soon. Hello [[Affine]]!
