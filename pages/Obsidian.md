- When I use this app last year (around May 2021), it was my first taste of what PKM is and interconnecting with my notes with other similar, related notes. Well, let's just say, apart from Google Notes, Evernotes and I did free trial on Notion, I feel in loved with Obsidian because of its open-source plain markdown files.You have your data on your machine.
- But things got a bit of U-turn (well, I did not abandon Obsidian, I pay for it to become Insider), I was introduced to [[logseq]] and that how it began.
- It is just a tool, an extension of how to use technology but still it boils down how you manage information.
- Right now, I'm looking forward to a collaborative feature which is the next-gen feature in the PKM space happening soon. Hello [[Affine]]!
