		- {{embed ((65164d87-8ce7-4daa-afca-c1908fad6f8d))}}
		- It is a specific denial. Unsa may e-deny?
		  background-color:: blue
			- Material facts or
			- Facts alleged in the pleading of the claimant (ang plaintiff ni) essential sa iyang cause of action.
		- #### Purpose
			- to specifically deny the material averments in the pleading of the claiming party (plaintiff-nagreklamo.) kay kaning specific denial mao ni nag create og issues in civil case/litigation.
			- Theses issues are to be proven and are the matters to which every evidence in a case is directed.
			- Kay kung wala ning issues, there is no necessity in going for a trial since nothing to prove or be proven. Sa Rules on Evidence in evidenciary matters, among napud ning na discuss on my 3rd year 2nd sem sa law school, there is no *factum probandum* (the matter or proposition to be proven.)
			- The matters should be laid down and compel the parties to show  their cards on the table. Alas ka, kamunggay hari? King of Hearts?
	- Kung naa specific denial duna sad diay **GENERAL denial**. So kung general denial, it is considered an admission.
	- A negative defense is stated in a form of a specific denial and the kinds of specific denials are described in Section 10 Rule 8.

	- **Mao ni ang three (3) forms or modes of specific denial:** #⭐️/remedial
	  background-color:: green
	  collapsed:: true
		- *First*, a defendant must specify each material allegation of fact the truth which he or she does not admit and, whenever practicable, shall set forth the substance of the matters upon which he or she relies to support his or her denial.
			- **Example:**
				- > Defendant denies the truth of the allegations in **para. 7** of the complaint alleging that he owes the plaintiff P450,000, the truth of the matter bening that it is the plaintiff who owes the defendant the same amount.
				- Kaning `para. 7` naka specific diha nga paragraph 7 in the complaint because the complaint is numbered para sayon ra emention which paragraph dapita e-deny or e-admit. Clear?
				- Kung walay nakabutang, moingon ra ug "I specifically deny the allegations in the complaint." This is a general denial, which in effect, is an submission. Bisan pa migamit syag "specifically" dili mahimo specific denial iyang answer. It is still a general denial.
				  background-color:: red
		- *Second*, where a defendant desires to deny only a part of an averment, he or she shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall denly only the remainder.
			- This second mode is called, "partial denial." Partly g-deny, partly dunay gi-admit in a **specific paragraph.**
			- **Example:**
				- *In an action for damages, the defendant avers:*
					- > "Defendant admits the allegations in paragraph 5 of the complaint, that Plaintiff sustained injuries when his car collided with the the herein Defendant's car, but denies the allegation that this collision occurred through Defendant's fault."
		- *Third*, where a defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a material avernment made in the complaint, he or she shall so state, and this shall have the effect of a denial.^{*Read:* Republic v. Gimenez, G.R. No. 174673, 11 Jan. 2016.}
			- This type of denial is called *"denial by disavowal of knowledge,"* and must be made sincerely and in **good faith**.^{Warner Barnes v. Reyes, 103 Phil. 662, 665.}
			- **Example:**
				- > Mr. D signs a promissory note in favor of Mr. P. Since Mr. D failed to pay despite demand, suit was brought against him. The complaint duly pleaded the promissory note as an actionable document. Mr. D denies the alleged promissory note **by averring lack of knowledge** of the note. This averment appears to be one in bad faith and shall be considered an admission because it is absurd for Mr. D not to know of the promissory note he himself signed. Migawas nani sa #bar/remedial/1978 #bar/remedial/1993
					- This denial in bad faith amounts to an admission. #bar/remedial/2004 #bar/remedial/2005

	- Ang denial sa answer must be definite kung unsay gi-admit ug unsay g-deny para ang adverse party maka andam ug dili magtagna2x kung asa dapita sa averment in the pleadings nga g-deny or g-admit.[^1] ^{`Sharo d masud sa akong utok.`}

	- #### NEGATIVE PREGNANT
	  collapsed:: true
		- *Unsa naman sad ning mananapa? Ka-la ba gud ani mga terminoha. Ato ning paksiton.*
		- Negative pregrant is a negative defense implying also an affirmative and which, although negative in form but really admits the allegations to which it relates.[^2]
			- [^2]: _{Cramer v. Aiken, 63 App. D.C. 16, 68 F, cited in Black's Law Dictionary, 5th ed., p. 930.}
		- It is a form of negative expression which carries with it an affirmation or at least an implication of some kind favorable to the adverse party.^{Valdez v. Dabon, Jr. A.C. No., 7353, 16 Nov. 2015.}
		- **Examples:**
			- (1) The defense alleges: "I had never borrowed money from the plaintiff from 2011 to 2013," implying that the pleader had borrowed money at some other time and was only denying that he did so during the years mentioned.
			- (2) A complaint alleges: " Plaintiff extended a loan to Defendant in the amount of P500,000 on July 27, 2016 in Cebu City." The Defendant, in his answer, alleges: "Defendant specifically denies that the Plaintiff extended a loan to Defendant in the amount of P500,000 in Cebu City."
				- > Notice that it is a mere repetition of the allegations in the complaint. It is clear that this answer does not deny anything but in fact implying some kind of favorable to the Plaintiff. The effect is that it is an admission that he borrowed money alleged although he may be denying the place where the loan was contracted.
	- #### Under Oath
		- As a rule, ang negative defense dili kinahanglan himoon in the form of specific denial in the material allegations alleged in the pleading of the claimant. Pero dunay time ang specific denial dili enough or sufficient for a negative defense.
		- So dunay instances that it must be made under oath. **For example:**
			- (a) Denial of an actionable document. Rule 8, sec. 8:
