  id:: 635f50a9-a8ed-4438-ab05-e4f74cf2cb55
	- All persons in whom or against whom any right to relief in respect to or arising out of the **same transaction or series of transactions** is alleged to exist, whether **jointly, severally**, or in **the alternative**, may, except as otherwise provided in these Rules, join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in one complaint, where **any question of law or fact common to all such plaintiffs or to all such defendants** may arise in the action; but the court may make such orders as may be just to prevent any plaintiff or defendant from being embarrassed or put to expense in connection with any proceedings in which he may have no interest. (6)
- **SECTION 7.** *Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties.*
  id:: 635f50a9-c4d1-4758-8381-d3fbb2376258
	- Parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. (7)
- **SECTION 8.** *Necessary party.*
	- A necessary party is one who is not indispensable but who ought to be joined as a party if complete relief is to be accorded as to those already parties, or for a complete determination or settlement of the claim subject of the action. (8a)
- **SECTION 9.** *Non-joinder of necessary parties to be pleaded.*
  id:: 6447bbc3-5ed4-416c-9502-5a52df4600d7
	- Whenever in any pleading in which a claim is asserted a necessary party is not joined, the pleader shall set forth his name, if known, and shall state why he is omitted.
	- Should the court find the reason for the omission unmeritorious, it may order the inclusion of the omitted necessary party if jurisdiction over his person may be obtained.
	- The failure to comply with the order for his inclusion, without justifiable cause, shall be deemed a waiver of the claim against such party.
	- The non-inclusion of a necessary party does not prevent the court from proceeding in the action, and the judgment rendered therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such necessary party. (8a, 9a)
- **SECTION 10.** *Unwilling co-plaintiff.*
	- If the consent of any party who should be joined as plaintiff can not be obtained, he may be made a defendant and the reason therefor shall be stated in the complaint. (10)
- **SECTION 11.** *Misjoinder and non-joinder of parties.*
  id:: 6447bbc3-2379-4c95-bd2e-cf285ae244fd
	- Neither misjoinder nor non-joinder of parties is ground for dismissal of an action.
	- Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.
	- Any claim against a misjoined party may be severed and proceeded with separately. (11a)
- **SECTION 12.** *Class suit.*
	- When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties, a number of them which the court finds to be sufficiently numerous and representative as to fully protect the interests of all concerned may sue or defend for the benefit of all.
	- Any party in interest shall have the right to intervene to protect his individual interest. (12a)
- **SECTION 13.** *Alternative defendants.*
	- Where the plaintiff is uncertain against who of several persons he is entitled to relief, he may join any or all of them as defendants in the alternative, although a right to relief against one may be inconsistent with a right of relief against the other. (13a)
- **SECTION 14.** *Unknown identity or name of defendant.*
	- Whenever the identity or name of a defendant is unknown, he may be sued as the unknown owner, heir, devisee, or by such other designation as the case may require; when his identity or true name is discovered, the pleading must be amended accordingly. (14)
- **SECTION 15.** *Entity without juridical personality as defendant.*
	- When two or more persons not organized as an entity with juridical personality enter into a transaction, they may be sued under the name by which they are generally or commonly known.
	- In the answer of such defendant, the names and addresses of the persons composing said entity must all be revealed. (15a)
- **SECTION 16.** *Death of party; duty of counsel.*
	- Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the claim is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the duty of his counsel to inform the court within thirty (30) days after such death of the fact thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or representatives.
	- Failure of counsel to comply with this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action.
	- The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint a guardian *ad litem* for the minor heirs.
	- The court shall forthwith order said legal representative or representatives to appear and be substituted within a period of thirty (30) days from notice.
	- If no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one so named shall fail to appear within the specified period, the court may order the opposing party, within a specified time, to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased and the latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased.
	- The court charges in procuring such appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs. (16a, 17a)
- **SECTION 17.** *Death or separation of a party who is a public officer.*
	- When a public officer is a party in an action in his official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action may be continued and maintained by or against his successor if, within thirty (30) days after the successor takes office or such time as may be granted by the court, it is satisfactorily shown to the court by any party that there is a substantial need for continuing or maintaining it and that the successor adopts or continues or threatens to adopt or continue the action of his predecessor.
	- Before a substitution is made, the party or officer to be affected, unless expressly assenting thereto, shall be given reasonable notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to be heard. (18a)
- **SECTION 18.** *Incompetency or incapacity.*
	- If a party becomes incompetent or incapacitated, the court, upon motion with notice, may allow the action to be continued by or against the incompetent or incapacitated person assisted by his legal guardian or guardian *ad litem*. (19a)
- **SECTION 19.** *Transfer of interest.*
	- In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. (20)
- **SECTION 20.** *Action on contractual money claims.*
  id:: 634fbaa1-1889-4f3a-a447-92281aa16a10
	- When the action is for recovery of money arising from contract, express or implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until the entry of final judgment.
	- A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff therein shall be enforced in the manner especially provided in these Rules for prosecuting claims against the estate of a deceased person. (21a)
- **SECTION 21.** *Indigent party.*
	- A party may be authorized to litigate his action, claim or defense as an indigent if the court, upon an *ex parte* application and hearing, is satisfied that the party is one who has no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his family.
	- Such authority shall include an exemption from payment of docket and other lawful fees, and of transcripts of stenographic notes which the court may order to be furnished him.
	- The amount of the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from paying shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent, unless the court otherwise provides.
	- Any adverse party may contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered by the trial court.
	- If the court should determine after hearing that the party declared as an indigent is in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be assessed and collected by the clerk of court.
	- If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court, execution shall issue or the payment thereof, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court may impose. (22a)
- **SECTION 22.** *Notice to the Solicitor General.*
  id:: 62f13798-e504-452a-84b4-2f6b1d30e98c
