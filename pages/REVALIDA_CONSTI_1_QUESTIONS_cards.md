## **INTRODUCTION:**
collapsed:: true
	- **Discuss the doctrine of constitutional supremacy.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under the doctrine of constitutional supremacy, **if a law or contract violates** any norm of the constitution that law or contract whether promulgated by the legislative or by the executive branch or entered into by private persons for private purposes is null and void and without any force and effect. Thus, since the Constitution is the fundamental, paramount and supreme law of the nation, it is deemed written in every statute and contract.
		- The Constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws and statutes must conform and to which all people, including the President, must uphold and support. No law shall be valid even in its noblest of intentions, if it conflicts with the Constitution. The Constitution must ever remain supreme. All must bow to the mandate of this law.
		- Expediency must not be allowed to sap its strength nor greed for power debase its rectitude. Right or wrong, the Constitution must be upheld as long as it has not been changed by the sovereign people lest its disregard result in the usurpation of the majesty of law by the pretenders to illegitimate power.
	- **Distinguish amendments from revisions of Constitution.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **1) Amendment:** an alteration of one or a few specific provisions of the Constitution. Its main purpose is to improve specific provisions of the Constitution. The changes brought about by amendments will not affect the other provisions of the Constitution.
		- 2) Revision: An examination of the entire Constitution to determine how and to what extent it should be altered. A revision implies substantive change, affecting the Constitution as a whole.
		- “Revision” is the  alterations of the different portions of the entire document [Constitution]. It may result in the rewriting whether the whole constitution, or the greater portion of it, or perhaps some of its important provisions. But whatever results the revision may produce, the factor that characterizes it as an act of revision is the original intention and plan authorized to be carried out. That intention and plan must contemplate a consideration of all the provisions of the Constitution to determine which one should be altered or suppressed or whether the whole document should be replaced with an entirely new one.
		- “Amendment” of the Constitution, on the other hand, envisages a change or only a few specific provisions. The intention of an act to amend is not to consider the advisability of changing the entire constitution or of considering that possibility. The intention rather is to improve specific parts of the existing constitution or to add to it provisions deemed essential on account of changed conditions or to suppress portions of it that seem obsolete, or dangerous, or misleading in their effect. (SINCO, Vicente, PHILIPPINE POLITICAL LAW)
	- **Discuss the three (3) mode of proposing amendments to the Constitution** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under the common interpretation of the Constitution, amendments can be proposed by one of three methods: a **People's Initiative**, a **Constituent Assembly** or a **Constitutional Convention.**
		- The proposal is usually made either directly by the Congress or by a constitutional convention. A special case is provided for where the proposal may be made directly by the people through initiative.
		  collapsed:: true
			- **The pertinent rules are:**
				- "Section 1. Any amendment to, or revision of, this Constitution may be proposed by:
					- **"(1) The Congress, upon a vote of three-fourths of all its Members; or**
					- "(2) A **constitutional convention.**
						- "Sec. 2. Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through **initiative** upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.
						- "The Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.
						- "Sec. 3. The Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of all its Members, call a **constitutional convention,** or by a majority vote of all its Members, submit to the electorate the question of calling such a convention."
	- **Discuss the “doctrine of proper submission” in connection with proposed amendments to the Constitution.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Amendments cannot be submitted to the people in a piecemeal fashion wherein the other amendments are to follow. The people should have a frame of reference from which to read the amendments being proposed. (Tolentino vs COMELEC)
		- The plebiscite may be held on the same day as regular election (Gonzales v COMELEC)provided the people are sufficiently informed of the amendments to be voted upon, to conscientiously deliberate thereon, to express their will in a genuine manner. Submission of piecemeal amendments is unconstitutional.
		- “Doctrine of Proper Submission” means all the proposed amendments to the Constitution shall be presented to the people for the ratification or rejection at the same time, not piecemeal. (TOLENTINO V. COMELEC, 41 SCRA 702)
	- **What is initiative? Discuss the three (3) kinds of initiative** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **“Initiative”** is the power of the people to propose amendments to the Constitution_ or _to propose and enact legislations through an election_ called for the purpose.
		- **There are three (3) systems of initiative, namely:**
			- a.1 I**nitiative on the Constitution** which refers to a petition proposing amendments to the Constitution;
			- a.2 **Initiative on statutes** which refers to a petition proposing to enact a national legislation; and
			- a.3 **Initiative on local legislation** which refers to a petition proposing to enact a regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay law, resolution or ordinance.
	- **Explain the distinction between original legislative power and derivative power** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- (1) Original legislative power- possessed by the sovereign people.
		- (2) Derivative legislative power- that which has been delegated by the sovereign people to the legislative bodies. (Kind of power vested in Congress)
		- 1.  Discuss the two sets to determine whether a proposed change in the Constitution is an amendment or a revision.
- ## **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND STATE POLICIES**
  collapsed:: true
	- collapsed:: true
	  1.  **Discuss at least five (5) manifestations of republicanism under the present Constitution** #card
		- That the Philippines is a republican state is manifested by the following facts:
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1.  **The existence in the Constitution of a Bill of Rights** which guarantees the right of the people to participate in public affairs, particularly through the right to information on matters of public concern; to form associations; freedom of speech and of the press; and the right of assembly and petition.
			- 2.  **Observance of the rule of the majority** in legislative, judicial, and administrative acts and proceedings.
			- 3.  **Observance of the principle of government of laws and not of man**, which is, that all acts of government must be done on the basis of existing laws and not in accordance with the personal whims and caprices of a person no matter how high his position in government may be.
			- 4.  **Observance of the principle of separation of powers and the system of check and balance** to prevent the concentration of powers in, and their abuse by, any official or agency of government.
			- 5.  The guarantee of suffrage for the expression of the sovereign will.
			- 6.  The concept of **public office as a public trust.**
			- 7.  The prescription of definite terms of office and ages for retirement from the public service.
			- 8.  The existence of laws on public officers, defining their powers, functions and duties, regulating their conduct, and prescribing the manner of their removal from office.
			- 9.  The prohibition against the passage of irrepealable laws.
	- **Under the 1987 Constitution, international law can become part of the sphere of domestic law either by transformation or incorporation. Discuss and distinguish.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The transformation method requires that an international law be transformed into a domestic law through a constitutional mechanism such as local legislation. The incorporation method applies when, by mere constitutional declaration, international law is deemed to have the force of domestic law.
		- Treaties become part of the law of the land through transformation pursuant to Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution which provides that “no treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate.” Thus, treaties or conventional international law must go through a process prescribed by the Constitution for it to be transformed into municipal law that can be applied to domestic conflicts.^[Pharmaceutical & Health Care Assn. of the Phil. v. Health Secretary Duque, et al., G.R. No. 173034, October 19, 2007)]
	- **Discuss the doctrine of autolimitation** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sovereignty is the property of the state-force due to which it has the exclusive capacity of legal self-determination and self-restriction.
	- **How do our courts resolve the issue where there appears to be a conflict between a rule of international law and the provisions of the Philippine Constitution and other prevailing statutes?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Generally accepted principles of international law, by virtue of the incorporation clause of the Constitution, form part of the laws of the land even if they do not derive from treaty obligations. The classical formulation in international law sees those customary rules accepted as binding result from the combination of two elements: the established, widespread, and consistent practice on the part of States; and a psychological element known as the opinion juris sive necessitates (opinion as to law or necessity). Implicit in the latter element is a belief that the practice in question is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it. ^[Mijares v. Ranada, G.R. No. 139325, April 12, 2005, 455 SCRA 397]
	- **Discuss the two (2) provisions of Constitution ensuring civilian authority, at all times, supreme over the military.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 3.** Civilian authority is, at all times, supreme over the military. The Armed Forces of the Philippines is the protector of the people and the State. Its goal is to secure the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of the national territory.
		- **SECTION 4.** The prime duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people. The Government may call upon the people to defend the State and, in the fulfillment thereof, all citizens may be required, under conditions provided by law, to render personal military or civil service.
	- **May Congress enact law requiring the mandatory registration in the military service? Discuss.** #card
	- **Discuss the benevolent neutrality theory** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under the benevolent-neutrality theory, the principle underlying the First Amendment is that freedom to carry out one's duties to a Supreme Being is an inalienable right, not one dependent on the grace of legislature.
	- **Discuss the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The concept of intergenerational responsibility hinges on the right of the present generation to sue in its behalf and in behalf of the succeeding generations for the protection of the environment. (oposa vs factoran)
		- The Court found no difficulty in ruling that they can, for themselves, for others of their generation and for the succeeding generations, file a class suit. Their personality to sue in behalf of the succeeding generations can only be based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned. Such a right, as hereinafter expounded, considers the "rhythm and harmony of nature."
		- The Court further elicited that every generation has a responsibility to the next to preserve that rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment of a balanced and healthful ecology.
	- **Explain the doctrine of separation of powers. What is its purpose?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The Doctrine of Separation of Powers entails: first, the division of the powers of the government into three, which are legislative, executive, and judicial; and second, the distribution of these powers to the three major branches of the government, which are the Legislative Department, Executive Department, and the Judicial Department. Basically, it means that the Legislative Department is generally limited to the enactment of the law and not to implementation or interpretation of the same; the Executive Department is generally limited to the implementation of the law and not to the enactment or interpretation of the same; and the Judicial Department is generally limited to the interpretation and application of laws in specific cases and not to the making or implementation of the same.
		- _Purpose of the Doctrine_
			- Prevention of Monopoly of Power. Separation of powers is said to be an attribute of republicanism, in that, among other reasons, it seeks to prevent monopoly or concentration of power to one person or group of persons, and thereby forestalls dictatorship or despotism. Sovereignty resides in the people, and it should remain that way. Government officials, who are the representatives of the people, must exercise the powers of their office in the interest of the public. While representational exercise of power brings out the essence of republicanism, too much concentration of power rips it apart, as was experienced some administrations.
			- The doctrine of separation of powers is intended to prevent a concentration of authority in one person or group of persons that might lead to an irreversible error or abuse in its exercise to the detriment of our republican institutions.
	- **What are the checks and balances that the executive department exercises insofar as legislative department and judiciary is concerned?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The Congress may refuse to give its concurrence to an amnesty proclaimed by the President^[Id. Art. VII, Sec. 19] and the Senate to a treaty he has concluded.[Id. Art. VII, Sec. 21] The Congress may limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that of inferior courts^[Id. Art. VIII, Sec. 1] and even abolish the latter tribunals.^[Id. Art. VII, Secs. 1,2; Ocampo v. Sec. of Justice, L-7918, prom. Jan. 18, 1955, 51 O.G. 147; De la Llana v. Alba, infra.]
	- **Cite five (5) instances of permissible delegation of power** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Delegation of legislative powers is permitted in the following cases:
			- **_(1) Delegation of tariff powers to the President._**
			  collapsed:: true
				- Article 6, Section 28(2). “The Congress may by law authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts, within the framework of the national development program of the Government.”
				- The reason for this delegation is the necessity, not to say expediency, of giving the chief executive the authority to act immediately on certain matters affecting the national economy lest delay result in hardship to the people.
			- **_(2) Delegation of emergency powers to the President._**
			  collapsed:: true
				- Article 6, Section 23(2). “In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may by law authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy. Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the Congress, such powers shall cease upon its next adjournment.”
				- The conditions for the vesture of emergency powers in the President are the following:
					- a. There must be war or other national emergency.
					- b. The delegation must be for a limited period only.
					- c. The delegation must be subject to such restrictions as the Congress may prescribe.
					- d. The emergency powers must be exercised to carry out a national policy declared by the Congress.
					- Important points:
						- * the emergency powers are self-liquidating unless sooner withdrawn.
						- * Conferment of emergency powers on the President is not mandatory on the Congress. The Congress may choose to hold on to its legislative powers and validly refuse to delegate it.
			- **_(3) Delegation to the people at large._**
				- The Congress further delegates its legislative power by allowing direct legislation by the people in cases of initiative and referendum.
			- **_(4) Delegation to local governments._**
				- This delegation is based on the principle that the local government is in better position than the national government to act on purely local concerns. Legislative power is therefore given to them for effective local legislation.
			- **_(5) Delegation to administrative bodies._**
				- The Congress delegates the so called “power of subordinate legislation” to administrative bodies. Due to the growing complexity of modern society, it has become necessary to allow specialized administrative bodies to promulgate supplementary rules, so that they can deal with technical problems with more expertise and dispatch than the Congress or the courts. Regulations or supplementary rules passed by the administrative bodies are intended to fill-in the gaps and provide details to what is otherwise a broad statute passed by Congress. For the rules and regulations to be valid and binding, they must be in accordance with the statute on which they are based, complete in themselves, and fix sufficient standards. If any of the requirements is not satisfied, the regulation will not be allowed to affect private rights

	- **Explain the concept of flexible tariff clause** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Article VI "Sec. 28(2) of the Constitution states that the Congress may by law authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts, within the framework of the national development program of the Government."
		- The President is granted stand-by or flexible tariff powers in the Tariff and Customs Code conformably to the above provision. The reason for this delegation is the necessity, not to say expediency, of giving the chief executive the authority to act immediately on certain matters affecting the national economy lest delay result in hardship to the people. It is recognized that the legislative process is much too cumbersome for the speedy solution of some economic problems, especially those relating to foreign trade.
		- Flexible Clause. – (a) In the interest of general welfare and national security, and subject to the limitations prescribed under this Act, the President, upon the recommendation of the NEDA, is hereby empowered to:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Increase, reduce, or remove existing rates of import duty including any necessary change in classification. The existing rates may be increased or decreased to any level, in one or several stages, but in no case shall the increased rate of import duty be higher than a maximum of one hundred percent (100%)ad valorem;
			- Establish import quotas or ban imports of any commodity, as may be necessary; and
			- Impose an additional duty on all imports not exceeding ten percent (10%)ad valorem whenever necessary: Provided,That upon periodic investigations by the Commission and recommendation of.the NEDA, the President may cause a gradual reduction of rates of import duty granted in Section1611 of this Act, including those subsequently granted pursuant to this section.
	- **Explain the power of subordinate legislation** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- It is the authority from the national legislature necessary to entrust to administrative agencies to issue rules to carry in order to out the general provisions of the statute.
		- The power to promulgate rules and regulations is only limited to carrying into effect what is provided in the legislative enactment.
		- The reason is the increasing complexity of the task of government and the growing inability of the legislature to cope directly with the myriad problems demanding its attention. The growth of society has ramified its activities and created peculiar and sophisticated problems that the legislature cannot be expected reasonably to comprehend. Specialization even in legislation has become necessary. To many of the problems attendant upon present-day undertakings, the legislature may not have the competence to provide the required direct and efficacious not to say, specific solutions. These solutions may, however, be expected from its delegates, who are supposed to be experts in the particular fields assigned to them.
		- The reasons given above for the delegation of legislative powers in general are particularly applicable to administrative bodies. With the proliferation of specialized activities and their attendant peculiar problems, the national legislature has found it more and more necessary to entrust to administrative agencies the authority to issue rules to carry out the general provisions of the statute.
- ## **CONCEPT OF THE STATE**
  collapsed:: true
	- **What is a state? What are the elements of a State?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- THE STATE is a community of persons, more or less numerous, permanently occupying a fixed territory, and possessed of an independent government organized for political ends to which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience.
		- The essential elements of a State are **_people, territory, government_ and _sovereignty._**
	- **Distinguish the concept of state from nation** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- A **State** is a community of persons more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, having a government of their own to which the great body of inhabitants render obedience, and enjoying freedom from external control while **Nation** indicates a relation of birth or origin and implies a common race, usually characterized by community of language and customs.
	- **Under the Montevideo Convention on Law of the State. what are the elements for the establishment of the state?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The accepted criteria for the establishment of a State as laid down by the Montevideo Convention as cited by the Supreme Court in The Province of North Cotabato v. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines Peace Panel on Ancestral Domain, specifies the accepted criteria for the establishment of a State, namely, a _permanent population,_ a _defined territory,_ a _government,_ and a _capacity to enter into relations with other states._
	- **What comprises the national territory of the Philippines?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas.
		- The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines. (ARTICLE 1)
	- **Discuss the straight baseline method.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under the straight baseline method, the baselines are lines drawn along the low water mark of an island or group of islands which mark the end of the internal waters and the beginning of the territorial sea. Imaginary straight lines are drawn joining the outermost points of the archipelago, enclosing an area the ratio of which should not be more than 9:1 (water to land), provided that the drawing baselines shall not depart, to any appreciable extent, from the general configuration of the archipelago.
	- **Does RA 9522 exclude the disputed Kalayaan Island Group from the National Territory of the Philippines?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- No. The Kalayaan Island Group lies within the Philippine territory and classified adjacent territories, like the Scarborough Shoal, as “regimes of islands” whose islands generate their own applicable maritime zones.
	- **Discuss the extent of our territorial sea, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under international law, the Philippines has sovereignty over its territorial sea (12 nautical miles), and jurisdiction over its EEZ (beyond 12 nautical miles up to 200 nautical miles). International law does not recognize sovereignty beyond the 12-nautical mile territorial sea.
		- RA 9522 is a statutory tool to demarcate the country’s maritime zones and continental shelf under UNCLOS III, not to delineate Philippine territory. Thus, baselines laws are nothing but statutory mechanisms for UNCLOS III States- parties to delimit with precision the extent of their maritime zones and continental shelves. In turn, this gives notice to the rest of the international community of the scope of the maritime space and submarine areas within which States parties exercise treaty-based rights, namely: the exercise of sovereignty over territorial waters (Article 2), the jurisdiction to enforce customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitation laws in the contiguous zone (Article 33), and the right to exploit the living and non-living resources in the exclusive economic zone (Article 56) and continental shelf (Article 77).
	- **What laws may be enforced by the State within the contiguous zone?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- In a zone contiguous to its territorial sea, described as the contiguous zone, the coastal State may exercise the control necessary to:
			- 1.  prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea;
			- 2.  punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.
			- The contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
	- **Explain the distinction between innocent passage from transit passage.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The **right of innocent passage** for foreign vessels within the territorial sea of a coastal State is defined as “navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose of (a) traversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters; or (b) proceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead or port facility.”
		- Passage must be “continuous and expeditious,” but it may include stopping and anchoring when incidental to ordinary navigation or rendered necessary by unusual circumstances.
		- The **right of transit passage** is defined as the exercise of the f**reedoms of navigation and overflight**, solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit through an international strait between one part of the high seas or an EEZ and another part of the high seas or an EEZ, in the normal modes of operation **utilized by ships and aircraft** for such passage.
		- An exception to the right of transit passage declares that the right “shall not apply if the strait is formed by an island of a State bordering the strait and its mainland” and “there exists seaward of the island a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics.”
		- Transit passage cannot be hampered or suspended by the coastal State for any purpose during peacetime. This also applies to transiting ships, including warships, of States at peace with the bordering coastal State but involved in armed conflict with another State.
		- The right of transit passage applicable in peacetime, along with the laws and regulations of States bordering straits adopted in accordance with international law, continue to apply during armed conflict. However, during transit belligerents must not conduct offensive operations against enemy forces, nor use such neutral waters as a place of sanctuary or as a base of operations.
		- The **most significant difference between transit passage and innocent passage** is that in transit passage submarines are allowed to navigate through the strait below the surface; the right of transit passage concerns also air transport. In innocent passage, then again, submarines are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag; the right of innocent passage does not apply to air transport.
	- **How do you distinguish a de jure government from de facto government?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- A **_de jure_ government** has rightful title but no power or control, either because this has been withdrawn from it or because it has not yet actually entered into the exercise thereof. A **_de facto_ government,** on the other hand, is a government of fact, that is, it actually exercises power or control but without legal title.
	- **Explain the concept of jus postliminium** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Principle of Jus Postliminium**— at the end of the occupation, when the occupant is ousted from the territory, the political laws which have been suspended shall automatically become effective again.
		- (Peralta vs. Director of Prisons, No. L049, November 12, 1945)
		- Example: A Roman citizen captured by the enemy was regarded by Roman law as a slave, except that his rights were not extinguished but in suspense. By virtue of the right of postliminium (literally return behind the threshold) a captive who returned recovered all his rights retrospectively, just as if he had never been captured. The principle applied only to rights, not to ‘facts’, i.e. to legal relationships which require for their existence some physical manifestation. Such relationships did not revive automatically, but had to be physically resumed. Thus *ownership revived automatically, but *possession did not; nor did marriage (but this rule was altered by Justinian; see justinian's codification). If the captive died in captivity, he died a slave; but a lex Cornelia (of the dictator *Sulla) preserved the validity of his will by the fiction that he died a citizen. This fiction was applied to successions on intestacy and was further extended in the post-classical law. Postliminium was applied also to land and to certain things important in war (slaves, ships, horses used in military service) which fell into enemy hands and were later recovered by their owner.
	- **Can foreign states be sued in the Philippines? Explain.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The basic concept of state immunity is that no state may be subjected to the jurisdiction of another state without its consent.
		- This doctrine may be invoked by any foreign state when it is sued in the country just as the Philippines may invoke sovereign immunity from suit filed in a foreign country, and except when it waives it, the suit will fail.
	- **Can state immunity from suit be waived? State the rules.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Waiver of the State’s immunity from suit**, being a derogation of sovereignty, will not be lightly inferred, but must be construed strictissimi juris (Republic v. Feliciano, 148 SCRA 424). The consent of the State to be sued must emanate from statutory authority, hence, from a legislative act, not from a mere memorandum. Without such consent, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the public respondents.
		- The doctrine, which says,  “the state may not be sued without its consent” is clear that the State may be sued, with its consent, either expressly or impliedly. Express consent may be made through a general law or a special law. The Philippine government consents, through Republic Act (RA) 3083, to be sued upon any money claim involving liability arising from contract, expressly or implied, which could serve as a basis of civil action between private parties. Implied consent, on the other hand, arises when the State itself commences litigation, thus opening itself to a counterclaim, or when it enters into a contract in its proprietary capacity but not in its sovereign or governmental capacity. In this situation, the government is deemed to have descended to the level of the other contracting party and to have divested itself of its sovereign immunity. When the state itself commences litigation, irrespective of whether or not it is in its proprietary or non-governmental capacity, it waives its immunity from suit (Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 204 SCRA 212 [1991]).
	- **When is a suit considered a suit against the state?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- A suit against the State is considered when the State may be said to have descended to the level of an individual and can thus be deemed to have tacitly given its consent to be sued only when it enters into a business contract. It does not apply where the contract relates to the exercise of its sovereign functions.’ (136 SCRA 487, 492.)
	- **For suits against unincorporated agencies, what is the test of suability?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- An unincorporated agency has no charter of its own and has no separate juridical personality but is merged in the general machinery of the government, like the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Mines and the Government Printing Office. The test of suability against unincorporated agencies is that any suit filed against it is necessarily an action against the Philippine Government of which it is a part. This being so, it is necessary to determine the nature of the functions in which the agency is engaged, so as to hold it suable if they are proprietary and not suable if they are governmental. The test in every case is the nature of the _primary_ functions being discharged.
		- An office of the Government, without any corporate or juridical personality cannot be sued. Any suit, action or proceeding against it, if it were to produce any effect, would actually be a suit, action or proceeding against the government itself, and the rule is settled that the Government cannot be sued without its consent, much less over its objection.
	- **How do you distinguish suability from liability?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- A state can never be held liable if it does not first consent to be sued. **SUABILITY** is just a matter of a state giving its consent to be sued.
		- *LIABILITY is a matter of applicable law and circumstance of the case. Liability is not conceded by the mere fact that the state has allowed itself to be sued. When the state does waive its sovereign immunity, it is only giving the plaintiff the chance to prove, if it can, that the defendant is liable.
		- *If performing a governmental function, even if it can be sued, the state cannot be held liable.
		- When the state give its consent to be sued, it is not admitting any liability, it is merely giving the claimant the opportunity to prove his claims as against the republic. After all, the liability of the republic may be determined on the basis of evidence produced by the parties in the course of the trial proper.
		- Suability is one thing. Liability is another.
		- Suability not equated with outright liability. Liability will have to be determined by the Court on the basis of the evidence and the applicable law.
- ## **CITIZENSHIP**
  collapsed:: true
	- **Who are citizens of the Philippines under the 1987 Constitution?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Article IV, Section 1. The following are citizens of the Philippines:
			- [1] Those who are citizens of the Philippines at the time of the adoption of this Constitution;

	  collapsed:: true
		- The Philippine law on citizenship adheres to the principle of jus sanguinis.

	- **If a child was born to a Filipina mother and an alien father before the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution, does the present Constitution recognize such child as Filipino? Explain.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Under Article IV, Section 1(3) of the 1935 Constitution, the citizenship of a legitimate child born of a Filipino mother and an alien father followed the citizenship of the father, unless, upon reaching the age of majority, the child elected Philippine citizenship.
		- This right to elect Philippine citizenship was recognized in the 1973 Constitution when it provided that "(t)hose who elect Philippine citizenship pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of nineteen hundred and thirty-five" are citizens of the Philippines. Likewise, this recognition by the 1973 Constitution was carried over to the 1987 Constitution which states that "(t)hose born before January 17, 1973 of Filipino mothers, who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority" are Philippine citizens. It should be noted, however, that the 1973 and 1987 Constitutional provisions on the election of Philippine citizenship should not be understood as having a curative effect on any irregularity in the acquisition of citizenship for those covered by the 1935 Constitution. If the citizenship of a person was subject to challenge under the old charter, it remains subject to challenge under the new charter even if the judicial challenge had not been commenced before the effectivity of the new Constitution.

	- **Distinguish dual citizenship from dual allegiance.** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Dual citizenship** arises when, as a result of the concurrent application of the different laws of two or more states, a person is simultaneously considered a national by the said states. For instance, such a situation may arise when a person whose parents are citizens of a state which adheres to the principle of jus sanguinis is born in a state which follows the doctrine of jus soli. Such a person, ipso facto and without any voluntary act on his part, is concurrently considered a citizen of both states.
		- **Dual allegiance**, on the other hand, refers to a situation in which a person simultaneously owes, by some positive act, loyalty to two or more states. While dual citizenship is involuntary, dual allegiance is the result of an individual’s volition, his participation in the naturalization process. (Mercado v.

X x x [T]he deliberations of the 1934 Constitutional Convention show that the framers intended foundlings to be covered by the enumeration. X x x Though the Rafols amendment was not carried out, it was not because there was any objection to the notion that persons of “unknown parentage” are not citizens but only because their number was not enough to merit specific mention.

		- Integration of the Philippine Bar means the official unification of the entire lawyer population of the Philippines. This requires membership and financial support (in reasonable amount) of every attorney as conditions sine qua non to the practice of law and the retention of his name in the Roll of Attorneys of the Supreme Court.
		- The term "Bar" refers to the collectivity of all persons whose names appear in the Roll of Attorneys. An Integrated Bar (or Unified Bar) perforce must include all lawyers.
		- Complete unification is not possible unless it is decreed by an entity with power to do so: the State. Bar integration, therefore, signifies the setting up by Government authority of a national organization of the legal profession based on the recognition of the lawyer as an officer of the court.
		- Designed to improve the position of the Bar as an instrumentality of justice and the Rule of Law, integration fosters cohesion among lawyers, and ensures, through their own organized action and participation, the promotion of the objectives of the legal profession, pursuant to the principle of maximum Bar autonomy with minimum supervision and regulation by the Supreme Court.
	- **Does membership in the IBP violate the constitutional right of association and property?** #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- No. the Courts have upheld the constitutionality of right of association and property.
		- The judicial pronouncements support this reasoning:
		- Courts have inherent power to supervise and regulate the practice of law.
		- The practice of law is not a vested right but a privilege; a privilege, moreover, clothed with public interest, because a lawyer owes duties not only to his client, but also to his brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the nation; and takes part in one of the most important functions of the State, the administration of justice, as an officer of the court.
		- Because the practice of law is privilege clothed with public interest, it is far and just that the exercise of that privilege be regulated to assure compliance with the lawyer's public responsibilities.
		- These public responsibilities can best be discharged through collective action; but there can be no collective action without an organized body; no organized body can operate effectively without incurring expenses; therefore, it is fair and just that all attorneys be required to contribute to the support of such organized body; and, given existing Bar conditions, the most efficient means of doing so is by integrating the Bar through a rule of court that requires all lawyers to pay annual dues to the Integrated Bar.
