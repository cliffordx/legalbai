	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 102.**
			- The owner of a ship has in all cases an insurable interest in it, even when it has been chartered by one who covenants to pay him its value to case of loss: **Provided**, *That* in this case the insurer shall be liable for only that part of the loss which the insured cannot recover from the charterer.
		- **SECTION 103.**
			- The insurable interest of the owner of the ship hypothecated by bottomry is only the excess of its value over the amount secured by bottomry.
		- **SECTION 104.**
			- Freightage, in the sense of a policy of marine insurance, signifies all the benefits derived by the owner, either from the chartering of the ship or its employment for the carriage of his own goods or those of others.
		- **SECTION 105.**
			- The owner of a ship has an insurable interest in expected freightage which according to the ordinary and probable course of things he would have earned but for the intervention of a peril insured against or other peril incident to the voyage.
		- **SECTION 106.**
			- The interest mentioned in the last section exists, in case of a charter party, when the ship has broken ground on the chartered voyage.

			- In marine insurance, each party is bound to communicate, in addition to what is required by [Section 28](((631c0ae7-5419-4cd0-8631-de59f53ad100))), all the information which he possesses, material to the risk, except such as is mentioned in [Section 30](((631c0ae7-1686-4274-bdde-cc4426f87f5a))), and to state the exact and whole truth in relation to all matters that he represents, or upon inquiry discloses or assumes to disclose.
		- **SECTION 110.**
			- In marine insurance, information of the belief or expectation of a third person, in reference to a material fact, is material.
		- **SECTION 111.**
			- A person insured by a contract of marine insurance is presumed to have knowledge, at the time of insuring, of a prior loss, if the information might possibly have reached him in the usual mode of transmission and at the usual rate of communication.
		- **SECTION 112.**
			- A concealment in a marine insurance, in respect to any of the following matters, does not vitiate the entire contract, but merely exonerates the insurer from a loss resulting from the risk concealed:
				- (a) The national character of the insured;
				- (b) The liability of the thing insured to capture and detention;
				- (c) The liability to seizure from breach of foreign laws of trade;
				- (d) The want of necessary documents; and

		- **SECTION 114.**
			- The eventual falsity of a representation as to expectation does not, in the absence of fraud, avoid a contract of marine insurance.
	- ### SUB-TITLE 1-E Implied Warranties
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 115.**
			- In every marine insurance upon a ship or freight, or freightage, or upon any thing which is the subject of marine insurance, a warranty is implied that the ship is seaworthy.
		- **SECTION 116.**
			- A ship is seaworthy when reasonably fit to perform the service and to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage contemplated by the parties to the policy.
		- **SECTION 117.**
			- An implied warranty of seaworthiness is complied with if the ship be seaworthy at the time of the commencement of the risk, except in the following cases:
				- (a) When the insurance is made for a specified length of time, the implied warranty is not complied with unless the ship be seaworthy at the commencement of every voyage it undertakes during that time; [and/or][^1]
				  (b) When the insurance is upon the cargo which, by the terms of the policy, description of the voyage, or established custom of the trade, is to be transhipped at an intermediate port, the implied warranty is not complied with unless each vessel upon which the cargo is shipped, or transhipped, be seaworthy at the commencement of each particular voyage.
					- [^1]: _{added by Paksiteer 10 Sept. 2022 2:06PM}
		- **SECTION 118.**
			- A warranty of seaworthiness extends not only to the condition of the structure of the ship itself, but requires that it be properly laden, and provided with a competent master, a sufficient number of competent officers and seamen, and the requisite appurtenances and equipment, such as ballasts, cables and anchors, cordage and sails, food, water, fuel and lights, and other necessary or proper stores and implements for the voyage.
		- **SECTION 119.**
			- Where different portions of the voyage contemplated by a policy differ in respect to the things requisite to make the ship seaworthy therefor, a warranty of seaworthiness is complied with if, at the commencement of each portion, the ship is seaworthy with reference to that portion.
		- **SECTION 120.**
			- When the ship becomes unseaworthy during the voyage to which an insurance relates, an unreasonable delay in repairing the defect exonerates the insurer on ship or shipowner's interest from liability from any loss arising therefrom.
		- **SECTION 121.**
			- A ship which is seaworthy for the purpose of an insurance upon the ship may, nevertheless, by reason of being unfitted to receive the cargo, be unseaworthy for the purpose of insurance upon the cargo.
		- **SECTION 122.**
			- Where the nationality or neutrality of a ship or cargo is expressly warranted, it is implied that the ship will carry the requisite documents to show such nationality or neutrality and that it will not carry any documents which cast reasonable suspicion thereon.
	- ### SUB-TITLE 1-F  The Voyage and Deviation
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 123.**
			- When the voyage contemplated by a marine insurance policy is described by the places of beginning and ending, the voyage insured is one which conforms to the course of sailing fixed by mercantile usage between those places.
		- **SECTION 124.**
			- If the course of sailing is not fixed by mercantile usage, the voyage insured by a marine insurance policy is that way between the places specified, which to a master of ordinary skill and discretion, would mean the most natural, direct and advantageous.
		- **SECTION 125.**
			- Deviation is a departure from the course of the voyage insured, mentioned in the last two (2) sections, or an unreasonable delay in pursuing the voyage or the commencement of an entirely different voyage.
		- **SECTION 126.**
			- A deviation is proper:
				- (a) When caused by circumstances over which neither the master nor the owner of the ship has any control;
				- (b) When necessary to comply with a warranty, or to avoid a peril, whether or not the peril is insured against;
				- (c) When made in good faith, and upon reasonable grounds of belief in its necessity to avoid a peril; or
				- (d) When made in good faith, for the purpose of saving human life or relieving another vessel in distress.
		- **SECTION 127.**
			- Every deviation not specified in the last section is improper.
		- **SECTION 128.**
			- An insurer is not liable for any loss happening to the thing insured subsequent to an improper deviation.
	- ### SUB-TITLE 1-G Loss
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 129.**
			- A loss may be either total or partial.
		- **SECTION 130.**
			- Every loss which is not total is partial.
		- **SECTION 131.**
			- A total loss may be either actual or constructive.
		- **SECTION 132.**
			- An actual total loss is caused by:
				- (a) total destruction of the thing insured;
				- (b) The irretrievable loss of the thing by sinking, or by being broken up;
				- (c) Any damage to the thing which renders it valueless to the owner for the purpose for which he held it; or
				- (d) Any other event which effectively deprives the owner of the possession, at the port of destination, of the thing insured.
		- **SECTION 133.**
			- A constructive total loss is one which gives to a person insured a right to abandon, under [Section 141](((db22b8cc-6235-4554-9a22-3fb56d2fcfad))).
		- **SECTION 134.**
			- An actual loss may be presumed from the continued absence of a ship without being heard of. The length of time which is sufficient to raise this presumption depends on the circumstances of the case.
		- **SECTION 135.**
			- When a ship is prevented, at an intermediate port, from completing the voyage, by the perils insured against, the liability of a marine insurer on the cargo continues after they are thus reshipped.
			- Nothing in this section shall prevent an insurer from requiring an additional premium if the hazard be increased by this extension of liability.
		- **SECTION 136.**
			- In addition to the liability mentioned in the last section, a marine insurer is bound for damages, expenses of discharging, storage, reshipment, extra freightage, and all other expenses incurred in saving cargo reshipped pursuant to the last section, up to the amount insured.
			- Nothing in this or in the preceding section shall render a marine insurer liable for any amount in excess of the insured value or, if there be none, of the insurable value.
		- **SECTION 137.**
			- Upon an actual total loss, a person insured is entitled to payment without notice of abandonment.
		- **SECTION 138.**
			- Where it has been agreed that an insurance upon a particular thing, or class of things, shall be free from particular average, a marine insurer is not liable for any particular average loss not depriving the insured of the possession, at the port of destination, of the whole of such thing, or class of things, even though it becomes entirely worthless; but such insurer is liable for his proportion of all general average loss assessed upon the thing insured.
		- **SECTION 139.**
			- An insurance confined in terms to an actual loss does not cover a constructive total loss, but covers any loss, which necessarily results in depriving the insured of the possession, at the port of destination, of the entire thing insured.
	- ### SUB-TITLE 1-H  Abandonment
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 140.**
			- Abandonment, in marine insurance, is the act of the insured by which, after a constructive total loss, he declares the relinquishment to the insurer of his interest in the thing insured.
		- **SECTION 141.**
		  id:: db22b8cc-6235-4554-9a22-3fb56d2fcfad
			- A person insured by a contract of marine insurance may abandon the thing insured, or any particular portion thereof separately valued by the policy, or otherwise separately insured, and recover for a total loss thereof, when the cause of the loss is a peril insured against:
				- (a) If more than three-fourths (3/4) thereof in value is actually lost, or would have to be expended to recover it from the peril;
				- (b) If it is injured to such an extent as to reduce its value more than three-fourths (3/4);
				- (c) If the thing insured is a ship, and the contemplated voyage cannot be lawfully performed without incurring either an expense to the insured of more than three-fourths (3/4) the value of the thing abandoned or a risk which a prudent man would not take under the circumstances; or
				- (d) If the thing insured, being cargo or freightage, and the voyage cannot be performed, nor another ship procured by the master, within a reasonable time and with reasonable diligence, to forward the cargo, without incurring the like expense or risk mentioned in the preceding subparagraph.
					- But freightage cannot in any case be abandoned unless the ship is also abandoned.
		- **SECTION 142.**
			- An abandonment must be neither partial nor conditional.
		- **SECTION 143.**
			- An abandonment must be made within a reasonable time after receipt of reliable information of the loss, but where the information is of a doubtful character, the insured is entitled to a reasonable time to make inquiry.
		- **SECTION 144.**
			- Where the information upon which an abandonment has been made proves incorrect, or the thing insured was so far restored when the abandonment was made that there was then in fact no total loss, the abandonment becomes ineffectual.
		- **SECTION 145.**
			- Abandonment is made by giving notice thereof to the insurer, which may be done orally, or in writing: **Provided**, *That* if the notice be done orally, a written notice of such abandonment shall be submitted within seven (7) days from such oral notice.
		- **SECTION 146.**
			- A notice of abandonment must be explicit, and must specify the particular cause of the abandonment, but need state only enough to show that there is probable cause therefor, and need not be accompanied with proof of interest or of loss.
		- **SECTION 147.**
			- An abandonment can be sustained only upon the cause specified in the notice thereof.
		- **SECTION 148.**
			- An abandonment is equivalent to a transfer by the insured of his interest to the insurer, with all the chances of recovery and indemnity.
		- **SECTION 149.**
			- If a marine insurer pays for a loss as if it were an actual total loss, he is entitled to whatever may remain of the thing insured, or its proceeds or salvage, as if there had been a formal abandonment.
		- **SECTION 150.**
			- Upon an abandonment, acts done in good faith by those who were agents of the insured in respect to the thing insured, subsequent to the loss, are at the risk of the insurer, and for his benefit.
		- **SECTION 151.**
			- Where notice of abandonment is properly given, the rights of the insured are not prejudiced by the fact that the insurer refuses to accept the abandonment.
		- **SECTION 152.**
			- The acceptance of an abandonment may be either express or implied from the conduct of the insurer.
			- The mere silence of the insurer for an unreasonable length of time after notice shall be construed as an acceptance.
		- **SECTION 153.**
			- The acceptance of an abandonment, whether express or implied, is conclusive upon the parties, and admits the loss and the sufficiency of the abandonment.
		- **SECTION 154.**
			- An abandonment once made and accepted is irrevocable, unless the ground upon which it was made proves to be unfounded.
		- **SECTION 155.**
			- On an accepted abandonment of a ship, freightage earned previous to the loss belongs to the insurer of said freightage; but freightage subsequently earned belongs to the insurer of the ship.
		- **SECTION 156.**
			- If an insurer refuses to accept a valid abandonment, he is liable as upon an actual total loss, deducting from the amount any proceeds of the thing insured which may have come to the hands of the insured.
		- **SECTION 157.**
			- If a person insured omits to abandon, he may nevertheless recover his actual loss.
	- ### SUB-TITLE 1-I Measure of Indemnity
	  collapsed:: true
		- **SECTION 158.**
			- A valuation in a policy of marine insurance is conclusive between the parties thereto in the adjustment of either a partial or total loss, if the insured has some interest at risk, and there is no fraud on his part; except that when a thing has been hypothecated by bottomry or *respondentia*, before its insurance, and without the knowledge of the person actually procuring the insurance, he may show the real value.
			- But a valuation fraudulent in fact, entitles the insurer to rescind the contract.
		- **SECTION 159.**
			- A marine insurer is liable upon a partial loss, only for such proportion of the amount insured by him as the loss bears to the value of the whole interest of the insured in the property insured.
		- **SECTION 160.**
			- Where profits are separately insured in a contract of marine insurance, the insured is entitled to recover, in case of loss, a proportion of such profits equivalent to the proportion which the value of the property lost bears to the value of the whole.
		- **SECTION 161.**
			- In case of a valued policy of marine insurance on freightage or cargo, if a part only of the subject is exposed to risk, the valuation applies only in proportion to such part.
		- **SECTION 162.**
			- When profits are valued and insured by a contract of marine insurance, a loss of them is conclusively presumed from a loss of the property out of which they are expected to arise, and the valuation fixes their amount.
		- **SECTION 163.**
			- In estimating a loss under an open policy of marine insurance the following rules are to be observed:
				- (a) The value of a ship is its value at the beginning of the risk, including all articles or charges which add to its permanent value or which are necessary to prepare it for the voyage insured;
				- (b) The value of the cargo is its actual cost to the insured, when laden on board, or where the cost cannot be ascertained, its market value at the time and place of lading, adding the charges incurred in purchasing and placing it on board, but without reference to any loss incurred in raising money for its purchase, or to any drawback on its exportation, or to the fluctuation of the market at the port of destination, or to expenses incurred on the way or on arrival;
				- (c) The value of freightage is the gross freightage, exclusive of primage, without reference to the cost of earning it; and
				- (d) The cost of insurance is in each case to be added to the value thus estimated.
		- **SECTION 164.**
			- If cargo insured against partial loss arrives at the port of destination in a damaged condition, the loss of the insured is deemed to be the same proportion of the value which the market price at that port, of the thing so damaged, bears to the market price it would have brought if sound.
		- **SECTION 165.**
			- A marine insurer is liable for all the expenses attendant upon a loss which forces the ship into port to be repaired; and where it is stipulated in the policy that the insured shall labor for the recovery of the property, the insurer is liable for the expense incurred thereby, such expense, in either case, being in addition to a total loss, if that afterwards occurs.
		- **SECTION 166.**
			- A marine insurer is liable for a loss falling upon the insured, through a contribution in respect to the thing insured, required to be made by him towards a general average loss called for by a peril insured against: **Provided**, *That* the liability of the insurer shall be limited to the proportion of contribution attaching to his policy value where this is less than the contributing value of the thing insured.
		- **SECTION 167.**
			- When a person insured by a contract of marine insurance has a demand against others for contribution, he may claim the whole loss from the insurer, subrogating him to his own right to contribution. But no such claim can be made upon the insurer after the separation of the interests liable to contribution, nor when the insured, having the right and opportunity to enforce contribution from others, has neglected or waived the exercise of that right.
		- **SECTION 168.**
			- In the case of a partial loss of ship or its equipment, the old materials are to be applied towards payment for the new. Unless otherwise stipulated in the policy, a marine insurer is liable for only two-thirds (2/3) of the remaining cost of repairs after such deduction, except that anchors must be paid in full.
- ## TITLE 2 Fire Insurance
  collapsed:: true
	- **SECTION 169.**
		- As used in this Code, the term fire insurance shall include insurance against loss by fire, lightning, windstorm, tornado or earthquake and other allied risks, when such risks are covered by extension to fire insurance policies or under separate policies.
	- **SECTION 170.**
		- An alteration in the use or condition of a thing insured from that to which it is limited by the policy made without the consent of the insurer, by means within the control of the insured, and increasing the risks, entitles an insurer to rescind a contract of fire insurance.
	- **SECTION 171.**
		- An alteration in the use or condition of a thing insured from that to which it is limited by the policy, which does not increase the risk, does not affect a contract of fire insurance.
	- **SECTION 172.**
		- A contract of fire insurance is not affected by any act of the insured subsequent to the execution of the policy, which does not violate its provisions, even though it increases the risk and is the cause of the loss.
	- **SECTION 173.**
		- If there is no valuation in the policy, the measure of indemnity in an insurance against fire is the expense it would be to the insured at the time of the commencement of the fire to replace the thing lost or injured in the condition in which it was at the time of the injury; but if there is a valuation in a policy of fire insurance, the effect shall be the same as in a policy of marine insurance.
	- **SECTION 174.**
		- Whenever the insured desires to have a valuation named in his policy, insuring any building or structure against fire, he may require such building or structure to be examined by an independent appraiser and the value of the insured's interest therein may then be fixed as between the insurer and the insured.
		- The cost of such examination shall be paid for by the insured.
		- A clause shall be inserted in such policy stating substantially that the value of the insured's interest in such building or structure has been thus fixed.
		- In the absence of any change increasing the risk without the consent of the insurer or of fraud on the part of the insured, then in case of a total loss under such policy, the whole amount so insured upon the insured's interest in such building or structure, as stated in the policy upon which the insurers have received a premium, shall be paid, and in case of a partial loss the full amount of the partial loss shall be so paid, and in case there are two (2) or more policies covering the insured's interest therein, each policy shall contribute pro rata to the payment of such whole or partial loss.
		- But in no case shall the insurer be required to pay more than the amount thus stated in such policy.
		- This section shall not prevent the parties from stipulating in such policies concerning the repairing, rebuilding or replacing of buildings or structures wholly or partially damaged or destroyed.
	- **SECTION 175.**
		- No policy of fire insurance shall be pledged, hypothecated, or transferred to any person, firm or company who acts as agent for or otherwise represents the issuing company, and any such pledge, hypothecation, or transfer hereafter made shall be void and of no effect insofar as it may affect other creditors of the insured.

		- The surety is entitled to payment of the premium as soon as the contract of [[suretyship]] or bond is perfected and delivered to the obligor.
		- No contract of [[suretyship]] or bonding shall be valid and binding unless and until the premium therefor has been paid, except where the obligee has accepted the bond, in which case the bond becomes valid and enforceable irrespective of whether or not the premium has been paid by the obligor to the surety: **Provided**, *That* if the contract of [[suretyship]] or bond is not accepted by, or filed with the obligee, the surety shall collect only a reasonable amount, not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the premium due thereon as service fee plus the cost of stamps or other taxes imposed for the issuance of the contract or bond: **Provided**, **however**, *That* if the nonacceptance of the bond be due to the fault or negligence of the surety, no such service fee, stamps or taxes shall be collected.
		- In the case of a continuing bond, the obligor shall pay the subsequent annual premium as it falls due until the contract of [[suretyship]] is cancelled by the obligee or by the Commissioner or by a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be.
