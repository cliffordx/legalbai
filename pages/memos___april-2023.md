	- Neurodivergent is a term that describes differences in the human brain that are natural and normal¹. It means that someone's brain processes, learns, and/or behaves differently from what is considered "typical" or "neurotypical"¹². Neurodivergent can include conditions such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder⁴, but not all neurodivergent people have a diagnosis or a disability¹³. Neurodivergent people may have different ways of perceiving, interpreting, and interacting with the world².

	- Gaslighting can take many forms and can be difficult to recognize. Here are some examples of gaslighting:
	  * Countering: Refusing to acknowledge a specific memory or event that has happened.
	  * Withholding: Refusing to engage in an actual conversation with you, and pretending to have no idea what you’re talking about.
	  * Trivializing: Making someone’s emotions seem unimportant or irrational.
	  * Denial: Denying something that has happened or denying something that was said.
	  * Diverting: Changing the subject to avoid accountability for something they’ve done.
	  * Stereotyping: Making someone feel like they’re too emotional, too sensitive, or too irrational to have a conversation with¹.

	- Yes, gaslighting can occur in academia and graduate school¹. Gaslighting in academia isn’t evident in a single incident, but occurs in relationships over time. Most often, these relationships involve some actual or perceived power differentials, which the gaslighter seeks to amplify¹. Within academia, perpetrators focus on harnessing their power to assert that they themselves are the only people who can be trusted¹. Gaslighting is an insidious, pernicious form of bullying that is gaining notoriety in nursing academia anecdotally³.

	- What's up memo? I see that I seldom jot my memo here. Probably because I mainly log from [[logseq]] now. Also, I disabled syncing to logseq because I feel that it lag logseq, but it is still a conjecture. I have no proof. My another culprit why it lag is the Logseq Co-pilot which I disabled ATM. (9:42PM)
	  
	  I notice the #lag happened when I left my machine, turned off wifi, and close the lid of my macbook. And when I returned and use logseq again, it slowed down or there is a delay. So, I decided to disable logseq co-pilot for now. I will observe it if it happens again or there is no more lag. Shalom!

	  * #ai/poe/GPT-4 As an AI language model, I cannot provide real-time updates or information on cases that may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021. However, I can share an example of a case in the Philippines that deals with the concept of guilty knowledge, which is the awareness or understanding that a person has about the illegal nature of their actions.
	  
	  * One such case is *People v. Abadilla* (G.R. No. L-43654, May 31, 1977). In this case, the defendant, a cashier at the Bureau of Treasury, was charged with malversation of public funds. The prosecution's claim was that the defendant knowingly and willfully misappropriated public funds for his own personal use. The defense argued that the defendant lacked guilty knowledge, as he was not aware that the funds were being misappropriated.
	  
	  * The Supreme Court of the Philippines ultimately found the defendant guilty, emphasizing that the evidence demonstrated the defendant's guilty knowledge. The Court noted that the defendant falsified documents and manipulated the funds under his control, which were clear indications of his awareness of the illegal nature of his actions.
	  
	  * While this case may not be directly related to collateral matters, it illustrates the concept of guilty knowledge within the Philippine legal system. In criminal cases, establishing guilty knowledge is often a critical element in proving the accused's guilt.
	  
	  * #PROMPT Can you explain how collateral matters relate to guilty knowledge in Philippine law and show me an actual case link
	  * #ai/poe/Claude+ In Philippine law, collateral matters refer to other circumstantial evidence that may establish the accused's guilty knowledge, apart from the main evidence of the crime. They provide context that the accused knew he was committing an illegal act.
	  
	  For example, in a case of theft, if witnesses testify that the accused was seen near the crime scene around the time of the theft, that can be collateral matter indicating his guilty knowledge. His presence near the scene suggests he knew about the theft, even if there is no direct evidence yet that he was the one who took the items.
	  
	  Here is an example case linking collateral matters and guilty knowledge:
	  
	  In People vs. Sabalones (G.R. No. 120971, Feb. 6, 1998), the accused was convicted of illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions. The main evidence was that the banned items were found in his house during a police search. 
	  
	  As collateral matters, the court also considered that:
	  
	  1) The accused was acting nervous during the search, indicating guilty knowledge of the illegal items. 
	  
	  2) He gave inconsistent reasons for the presence of the firearms. Again, this reflects his guilty knowledge. 
	  
	  3) He tried to bribe the police officers, showing effort to hide his crime. 
	  
	  The court said these collateral matters established the accused's guilty knowledge of illegal possession, in addition to the primary evidence that the items were found in his house.
	  
	  Here is the full text of the case: https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1998/feb1998/gr_120971_1998.html

	- Insights on the indictment of Bantag et al
	  The DOJ panel of prosecutors recommended the filing of two counts of Murder against former Bucor head, Gerald Bantag, and others.
	  They were charged in connection with the killing of Percival Lapid and inmate Cristito Palana.
	  The indictment of Bantag stems from the conspiracy where he allegedly masterminded the killings of the victims. He is the alleged principal by inducement. The others were considered as principals by indispensable cooperation and by direct participation.
	  The crime of Murder is punished under Article 248.of the Revised Penal Code. If found guilty, the accused can be meted with the indivisible penalty of reclusion perpetua with a maximum term of 40 years of imprisonment including accessory penalties.
	  As a capital crime, the accused  is not entitled to bail although they may file a petition for bail on the ground that the evidence of guilt is not strong. Under the charge, bail is a matter of discretion, and not a matter of right. 
	  Once the accused file a bail petition, the  prosecution will present evidence to prove that evidence of guilt is strong. On the basis of that, the trial court may or may not grant the petition.
	  The defense  must study carefully this option. Once the court denies the petition, that will be perceived as a sign that it will convict the accused for the crime charged. It thus "abbreviates" the proceedings since the prosecution will just adopt the evidence adduced in the bail proceeding as its evidence-in-chief.
	  As a former practitioner, I do not encourage filing of bail petition if, upon assessment of the case,  the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. Once denied, the accused  has a limited "elbow room" in interposing its defense due to either limited of time or scarcity of witnesses. @/People/Fred Nojara [source](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0E6TLYdXsXXzZZJ54wvb5PwKpuZGcNjA9a5LK2qCdwh4z7nzSBqXCf8ny1tb9pLvdl&id=100069350906809&__cft__[0]=AZWz4NM5OCsw9xB_UF78zoC-JGLV3O2XT5AlMfo0NzZeZvcOYotgmnvS0f3r1v8PNA-wq_2hWZxCyVRqYI_KciLUcFVhqx8ijdczQeTIf7GrBfILE_IFg--BWo7IP4wEPbIq8C-N1xbsTduziKkKpOyJ5uIuxg4LsE90lrAtI70tJ07U-fCi1ZnqNpZAVP4T3Ns&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R)

	- The complainants in this case argue that the Bureau of Immigration's poster at the NAIA's Immigration section, which prohibits the use of cellular phones or video recording devices and the sharing of photos/videos of any Immigration Personnel, is a violation of their right to free speech and expression. They contend that the Bureau of Immigration is a public office and its personnel are public officials, thus they are subject to scrutiny and criticism by the public.
	  
	  On the other hand, the Bureau of Immigration argues that the poster is necessary to protect the privacy and security of its personnel. The Bureau maintains that the use of cellular phones and video recording devices by passengers waiting in line at the BI counters can compromise the safety of its personnel by allowing the unauthorized capture of sensitive information or images.
	  
	  The Bureau further asserts that the prohibition is not a violation of the Data Privacy Act since it is within its mandate to protect its personnel from any form of harm or abuse, whether physical or emotional. Moreover, the Bureau argues that the use of cellular phones and other recording devices can be a tool for cyberbullying or other forms of harassment against its personnel.
	  
	  The complainants counter that the Bureau's position is untenable since the Data Privacy Act does not apply to government agencies and their personnel. They also argue that the prohibition is overly broad and infringes on their right to free speech and expression.
	  
	  The Bureau responds that the prohibition is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, namely the protection of its personnel. The Bureau further argues that the prohibition is not absolute since passengers can still voice their complaints or criticisms to the appropriate authorities without resorting to the use of cellular phones or recording devices.
	  
	  The complainants maintain that the prohibition has caused inconvenience and disruption to passengers, resulting in missed flights and other inconveniences. They argue that the Bureau should have implemented less intrusive measures, such as providing designated areas for passengers to use their cellular phones or recording devices.
	  
	  The Bureau responds that it has already taken steps to address the complaints of passengers, such as increasing the number of personnel and opening additional counters to reduce waiting time. The Bureau also argues that it has the authority to regulate the use of cellular phones and recording devices within its premises.
	  
	  In conclusion, the issue in this case is whether the Bureau of Immigration's prohibition on the use of cellular phones and recording devices by passengers waiting in line at the BI counters is a violation of their right to free speech and expression. While the Bureau has a legitimate interest in protecting its personnel, it should balance this interest against the rights of passengers to express their opinions and criticisms. The Commission should carefully weigh the arguments of both parties and determine whether the prohibition is a reasonable and necessary restriction on the passengers' right to free speech and expression.

	- * #PROMPT True or false: in the Philippines dowry is a donation given on account of marriage
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] False. In the Philippines, a dowry is not a donation given on account of marriage. Instead, it is called "bigay-kaya" or "tulong" which means a contribution or assistance provided by the groom's family to help the couple start their new life together. It is not a requirement in Philippine marriages and is usually given voluntarily.
	  
	  
	  * #PROMPT If mr A's debt is condoned but debtor did not render service in favor of the creditor the transaction is subject to donor's tax
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] Yes, if Mr. A's debt is condoned (i.e. cancelled or forgiven) by the creditor, but Mr. A did not render any service in favor of the creditor, the transaction may be subject to donor's tax under Philippine law.
	  
	  Under the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines, a donor's tax is imposed on the transfer of property by gift. The term "gift" includes the transfer of property without consideration or for less than adequate and full consideration. If a creditor cancels a debt owed by a debtor without receiving anything in return (i.e. without the debtor rendering any service or paying any consideration), it may be considered as a gift subject to donor's tax.
	  
	  The donor's tax rate in the Philippines depends on the value of the gift and the relationship between the donor and the donee. If the donor and donee are not related, the donor's tax rate is 30% of the net gift. If they are related, the tax rate ranges from 2% to 15% of the net gift, depending on the value of the gift and the degree of relationship.
	  
	  
	  * #PROMPT True or false if an individual performs services for a creditor who in consideration thereof cancels the dead the transaction is subject to donor's tax
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] False. If an individual performs services for a creditor in exchange for the cancellation of a debt, the transaction would not be subject to donor's tax in the Philippines.
	  
	  Under the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines, a donor's tax is imposed on the transfer of property by gift, including the transfer of property without consideration or for less than adequate and full consideration. However, if an individual performs services for a creditor in exchange for the cancellation of a debt, there is a consideration involved, which is the services rendered by the individual. This means that the cancellation of the debt is not a gift, but rather a payment for the services rendered.
	  
	  In this case, the individual who rendered the services should include the value of the debt cancelled as part of his or her gross income for tax purposes, since it is considered as a form of compensation for the services rendered. The creditor may also claim the amount of the cancelled debt as a deduction for tax purposes, provided that it meets the requirements under the tax law.
	  
	  * #PROMPT Under the train law of the philippines if the donee is a stranger to the donor the tax rate is equivalent to 30% of the net gifts
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] Yes, that statement is correct.
	  
	  Under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law of the Philippines, which took effect on January 1, 2018, if the donee is a stranger to the donor, the donor's tax rate is 30% of the net gifts.
	  
	  The term "stranger" refers to any person who is not a brother, sister (whether by whole or half-blood), spouse, ancestor, or lineal descendant of the donor. In other words, if the donor and donee are not related within the specified degree of relationship, the donor's tax rate is 30% of the net gifts.
	  
	  The net gifts refer to the total gifts less allowable deductions (such as the basic and additional exemptions). The donor is responsible for paying the donor's tax, which is based on the net gifts received during the calendar year.
	  
	  
	  * #PROMPT Tour falls donor's tax return shall be filed within one year after the date of the gift is made or completed
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] False. Under Philippine tax laws, the donor's tax return should be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of the gift.
	  
	  Specifically, Section 99(B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines provides that "the return of the donor shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the date the gift is made, except that when the gift is made in contemplation of the donor's death, the return shall be filed by the executor or administrator of his estate within six (6) months after the donor's death."
	  
	  * #PROMPT Filing the donor's tax return beyond the prescribed period may result in penalties and interests imposed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), depending on the amount of tax due and the length of the delay.
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] That statement is false. The rule on reciprocal or interrelated gifts applies to both estate tax and donor's tax in the Philippines.
	  
	  Under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines, the value of interrelated gifts made by the donor and the donee during their lifetimes or at the time of the donor's death shall be included in computing the donor's or estate tax, as the case may be.
	  
	  In other words, if the donor and the donee have made gifts to each other, the value of these gifts will be considered in determining the amount of donor's tax or estate tax that should be paid. This is to prevent the avoidance of taxes by individuals who might attempt to give away their assets to their heirs or beneficiaries through interrelated gifts in order to minimize or avoid the payment of taxes.
	  
	  To determine the amount of donor's or estate tax due on interrelated gifts, the value of the gifts made by the donor to the donee shall be added to the value of the gifts made by the donee to the donor. The tax due shall be computed based on the aggregate value of the gifts. The rule on reciprocal or interrelated gifts is therefore applicable to both donor's tax and estate tax in the Philippines.
	  
	  * #PROMPT Lyndon a citizen and resident of porto rico donated $1000 worth of stocks in lean corporation aperture recon company to is legitimate son miguelito who is residing in the philippines assume that porto rico does not impose any transfer tax of whatever nature on all graduates of transversal property is the donation subject to donor's tax in the philippines? Explain
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] Yes, the donation of $1000 worth of stocks in Lean Corporation Aperture Recon Company by London, a citizen and resident of Puerto Rico to his legitimate son Miguelito, who is residing in the Philippines, is subject to donor's tax in the Philippines, even if Puerto Rico does not impose any transfer tax on the donation.
	  
	  Under the Philippine National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), the donation of intangible personal property, such as stocks, by a non-resident alien to a resident of the Philippines is subject to donor's tax if the property is situated in the Philippines. In this case, since the stocks are intangible personal property, the location of the stocks is deemed to be where the stock certificates are physically located, which is in the Philippines since the donee, Miguelito, is residing in the Philippines.
	  
	  The donor's tax rate will depend on the relationship between the donor and the donee. If the donee is the donor's legitimate son, like in this case, the first Php 250,000 of the net gift will be exempt from donor's tax, and the excess over Php 250,000 will be subject to a flat rate of 6%.
	  
	  However, the fact that Puerto Rico does not impose any transfer tax on the donation may be relevant in determining the total amount of taxes due and payable by the donor. The Philippines has an existing tax treaty with the United States, of which Puerto Rico is a territory, that aims to avoid double taxation and promote trade and investment between the two countries. The provisions of the tax treaty may provide relief or exemption from Philippine donor's tax, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  * #PROMPT Does the rule on reciprocity apply in this case. Explain
	  
	  [[ai/chatgpt]] The rule on reciprocity may apply in this case if there is an existing tax treaty or agreement between the Philippines and Puerto Rico that provides for reciprocity in the treatment of transfer taxes.
	  
	  Under the rule on reciprocity, if the laws of the country of the donor do not impose any transfer tax on the donation, the Philippines may grant an exemption or a reduction of the donor's tax in favor of the donor, provided that there is a similar exemption or reduction granted by the donor's country to Filipino citizens who make similar donations.
	  
	  In this case, since the donor, London, is a resident and citizen of Puerto Rico, the Philippine government may consider the tax laws of Puerto Rico in determining the applicable donor's tax on the gift of stocks. If Puerto Rico does not impose any transfer tax on the gift of stocks, the Philippine government may grant an exemption or a reduction of the donor's tax in favor of London, provided that there is a similar exemption or reduction granted by Puerto Rico to Filipino citizens who make similar donations.
	  
	  However, it is important to note that the applicability of the rule on reciprocity may depend on the specific provisions of the tax treaty or agreement between the Philippines and Puerto Rico, if any. The terms and conditions of the tax treaty may vary depending on the specific provisions agreed upon by the two countries, and may affect the application of the rule on reciprocity. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a tax professional or seek guidance from the relevant government agencies to determine the applicability of the rule on reciprocity in this case.

	- **INFLUENCING PEDDLING UNETHICAL**
	  * In less than two weeks, the Supreme Court rendered three per curiam decisions imposing administrative sanctions on three erring members of the bar.
	  * The first case involved a lawyer who assured his client that the petition for annulment of marriage since the judge was notorious in granting annulment. The judge, according to the counsel, was known for his laxity in granting petitions of this nature. The second lawyer was disbarred after he told his client that he could bribe the Court of Appeals justices who were handling their case.  
	  * On the other hand, the latest decision (which has yet to be uploaded ) pertains to a lawyer who also assured his client that he could secure a winning resolution by bribing a Makati prosecutor. In this case, the lawyer was handling a criminal case pending before the prosecutor's. He obtained a huge sum of money from his client to be used as a bribe money to be given to the handling prosecutor. Despite the bribe giving, the client lost the case. Feeling aggrieved, he filed a case against the lawyer accusing the latter of having acted as a fixer, solicited money from him to influence the prosecutor, and failed to provide accounting thereof.
	  * The Court disbarred the lawyer for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility. It reminded lawyers not to engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, and deceitful conduct. It observed that the lawyer's act of influencing-peddling for implying that he is able to influence a public official, tribunal or legislative body erodes the public trust and confidence in the legal system and puts the administration in a bad light.

	  According to some online sources¹², GlutaMAX has a bar soap that is suitable for both face and body¹². It claims to lighten uneven skin tone and discolorations while revitalizing and restoring the youthful vibrancy of your skin³. However, as I mentioned before, you should always do a patch test before using any product on your face and use sunscreen when using any lightening products.
	  
	  As for your son's behavior, it sounds like he is going through puberty, a natural process of physical and emotional changes that occurs during adolescence. Puberty can make teenagers more conscious of their appearance and more interested in grooming themselves. It can also affect their mood, self-esteem, and relationships with others. This is normal and part of growing up. You can support your son by being understanding, respectful, and supportive of his choices. You can also talk to him about his feelings and concerns if he is comfortable with that.

	  Puberty is a process of physical changes that happens when a child's body matures and becomes ready for reproduction. Puberty usually begins between **10 and 16** years old for boys¹² and lasts about **2 to 5** years¹². However, every boy is different and may start puberty at a different time or pace³.
	  
	  Puberty involves many changes in boys' bodies, such as growth of genitals, hair, muscles, bones and voice. These changes happen in stages called Tanner stages⁴. There are five Tanner stages for boys, ranging from stage 1 (prepubertal) to stage 5 (adult).
	  
	  Is there anything specific you want to know about puberty for boys?👦
