- ## Welcome to Legal Bai
	- This is [my]([[Clifford Enoc]]) repository of law notes, codal annotations and/or commentaries in my study of law, here in the Philippines. At the time of writing this welcome/index page [28 July 2022], I am on my third year in law school. `updated: Oct 26, 2022: 13:06:00`
	- Law school is tough, but "I am tougher." — The Paksiteer
- ### What can you expect from my Github page?
	- A ton.
	- Since I am doing hybrid/multi-faceted approach to learning, my overarching goal is to write my own words and thoughts about what I have studied so far, here in Github. My previous plan was to have it in one place at my website (CliffordX.com) but I wanted it here since I just have to `commit` the pages that I hav written on my PKM app (logseq, FTW!) and it shall be published with updates and shown here instantly. It makes my workflow much easier.
	- I do have handwritten outlines, notes on a 4"x6" [index card]([[Index_Cards]]) which I already plan to write simultaneously or concurrently with my typewritten notes here. I plan to upload also those handwritten notes if it so required. (But I'm lazy, [here's my alibi]([[26 Oct 2022]])
	- For those who want to engage in effective note-taking strategies, here is my list of recommended (e)Books to read in alphabetical order on the subject of note-taking:
		- 1. Building A Second Brain by Tiago Forte, 2022
		- 2. Digital Zettelkasten by David Kadavy, 2021
		- 3. How To Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens, 2022
		- 4. Remember: The Science of Memory and The Art of Forgetting by Lisa Genova, 2021.
