- # Welcome to Legal Bai
	- This is [my]([[Clifford Enoc]]) repository of law notes, codal annotations and/or commentaries in my study of law, here in the Philippines. At the time of writing this welcome/index page [28 July 2022], I am on my third year in law school. `updated: Oct 26, 2022: 13:06:00`
	- Law school is tough, but "I am tougher." — The [Paksiteer]([[Clifford Enoc]])

- ## How to navigate this site?
	- You can collapse or uncollapse a heading to either show or hide subgroup or underneath the title. Next to this is a title `What can you expect from my Github page` there's a `.` on the left but DO NOT click yet, as that will open into separate page. After you  hover, you will see a drop/side arrow, depending if the page is hidden or already shown. Do try it!
	- Next, there's a left side menu bar and right side menu bar. Go over them and let me know if you find something interesting. ;)
- ### What can you expect from my Github page?
	- A ton. For starters, I have #[[flashcards]] collated and collected from exams and quizzes.
	- Also, I have the fundamental codals uploaded here, either annotated or commented by [me]([[Clifford Enoc]]).
		- But don't expect too much. Some are not meant to be shared.
			- Reason: Some are from authors of a law book.
				- Others are from law review pdfs floating around but its already there.
				- > NOTE: If you find a gibberish code something like this `((635a41f7-2049-491e-8838-b8d5119d291f)),` it means that the link reference is to some other annotated document, *i.e.,* PDF file, that no longer appear from this site because it was deleted but I'm sure it appear somewhere, *i.e.,* on my local machine (my laptop/phone).
	- Since I am doing hybrid/multi-faceted approach to learning, my overarching goal is to write my own words and thoughts about what I studied and learned from my simple understanding so far, here in Github.
	- My previous plan was to have it in one place at my website (CliffordX.com) but I wanted it here since I just have to `commit` the pages that I have written on my PKM app ([[logseq]], FTW!) from my laptop and it shall be published with updates and shown here [instantly]([[publishing]]).
	- **It makes my workflow much easier.**
	- I do have handwritten outlines, notes on a 4"x6" [index card]([[Index_Cards]]) which I already plan to write simultaneously or concurrently with my typewritten notes here. I plan to upload also those handwritten notes if it so required. (But I'm busy, [here's my lazy alibi]([[26 Oct 2022]]))
	- For those who want to engage in effective note-taking strategies, here is my list of recommended (e)Books to read in alphabetical order on the subject of note-taking:
