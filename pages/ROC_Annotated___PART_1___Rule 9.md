		- In such case, the order of default may be set aside on such terms and conditions as the judge may impose in the interest of justice. (3a, R18)
	- (c) *Effect of partial default.* — When a pleading asserting a claim states a common cause of action against several defending parties, some of whom answer and the others fail to do so, the court shall try the case against all upon the answers thus filed and render judgment upon the evidence presented.
