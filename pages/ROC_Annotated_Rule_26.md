	- Objections to any request for admission shall be submitted to the court by the party requested within the period for and prior to the filing of his <ins>or her</ins> sworn statement as contemplated in the preceding paragraph and his <ins>or her</ins> compliance therewith shall be deferred until such objections are resolved, which resolution shall be made as early as practicable. (2a)
- **SECTION 3.** Effect of admission.
	- Any admission made by a party pursuant to such request is for the purpose of the pending action only and shall not constitute an admission by him <ins>or her</ins> for any other purpose nor may the same be used against him <ins>or her</ins> in any other proceeding. (3)
