	- The applicant must show by his own affidavit or that of some other person who personally knows the facts:
		- (a) That the applicant is the owner of the property claimed, particularly describing it, or is entitled to the possession thereof;
		- (b) That the property is wrongfully detained by the adverse party, alleging the cause of detention thereof according to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief;
		- (c) That the property has not been distrained or taken for a tax assessment or a fine pursuant to law, or seized under a writ of execution or preliminary attachment, or otherwise placed under *custodia legis*, or if so seized, that it is exempt from such seizure or custody; and
		- (d) The actual market value of the property.
		- The applicant must also give a bond, executed to the adverse party in double the value of the property as stated in the affidavit aforementioned, for the return of the property to the adverse party if such return be adjudged, and for the payment to the adverse party of such sum as he may recover from the applicant in the action. (2a)
- **SECTION 3.** Order.
	- Upon the filing of such affidavit and approval of the bond, the court shall issue an order and the corresponding *writ of replevin* describing the personal property alleged to be wrongfully detained and requiring the sheriff forthwith to take such property into his custody. (3a)
- **SECTION 4.** Duty of the sheriff.
	- Upon receiving such order, the sheriff must serve a copy thereof on the adverse party, together with a copy of the application, affidavit and bond, and must forthwith take the property, if it be in the possession of the adverse party, or his agent, and retain it in his custody.
	- If the property or any part thereof be concealed in a building or enclosure, the sheriff must demand its delivery, and if it be not delivered, he must cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and take the property into his possession.
	- After the sheriff has taken possession of the property as herein provided, he must keep it in a secure place and shall be responsible for its delivery to the party entitled thereto upon receiving his fees and necessary expenses for taking and keeping the same. (4a)
- **SECTION 5.** Return of property.
	- If the adverse party objects to the sufficiency of the applicant's bond, or of the surety or sureties thereon, he cannot immediately require the return of the property, but if he does not so object, he may, at any time before the delivery of the property to the applicant, require the return thereof, by filing with the court where the action is pending a bond executed to the applicant, in double the value of the property as stated in the applicant's affidavit for the delivery thereof to the applicant, if such delivery be adjudged, and for the payment of such sum to him as may be recovered against the adverse party, and by serving a copy of such bond on the applicant. (5a)
- **SECTION 6.** Disposition of property by sheriff.
	- If within five (5) days after the taking of the property by the sheriff, the adverse party does not object to the sufficiency of the bond, or of the surety or sureties thereon; or if the adverse party so objects and the court affirms its approval of the applicant's bond or approves a new bond, or if the adverse party requires the return of the property but his bond is objected to and found insufficient and he does not forthwith file an approved bond, the property shall be delivered to the applicant.
	- If for any reason the property is not delivered to the applicant, the sheriff must return it to the adverse party. (6a)
- **SECTION 7.** Proceedings where property claimed by third person.
	- If the property taken is claimed by any person other than the party against whom the *writ of replevin* had been issued or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto, or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds therefor, and serves such affidavit upon the sheriff while the latter has possession of the property and a copy thereof upon the applicant, the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property under *replevin* or deliver it to the applicant unless the applicant or his agent, on demand of said sheriff, shall file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property under *replevin* as provided in [Section 2](((f2254188-0af9-4349-9ee3-3cea7b292dfc))) hereof.
	- In case of disagreement as to such value, the court shall determine the same.
	- No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.
	- The sheriff shall not be liable for damages, for the taking or keeping of such property, to any such third-party claimant if such bond shall be filed.
	- Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to the property, or prevent the applicant from claiming damages against a third-party claimant who filed a frivolous or plainly spurious claim, in the same or a separate action.
	- When the writ of *replevin* is issued in favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or any officer duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff is sued for damages as a result of the *replevin*, he shall be represented by the Solicitor General, and if held liable therefor, the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of the funds to be appropriated for the purpose. (7a)
- **SECTION 8.** Return of papers.
	- The sheriff must file the order, with his proceedings indorsed thereon, with the court within ten (10) days after taking the property mentioned therein. (8a)
- **SECTION 9.** Judgment.
	- After trial of the issues, the court shall determine who has the right of possession to and the value of the property and shall render judgment in the alternative for the delivery thereof to the party entitled to the same, or for its value in case delivery cannot be made, and also for such damages as either party may prove, with costs. (9a)
- **SECTION 10.** Judgment to include recovery against sureties.
	- The amount, if any, to be awarded to any party upon any bond filed in accordance with the provisions of this Rule, shall be claimed, ascertained, and granted under the same procedure as prescribed in [Section 20](((f57f0d30-157a-44bc-9947-849ed50d3be3))) of Rule 57. (10a)
