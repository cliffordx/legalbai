		- In such cases, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.”
		  
		  The amendment made in A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, approved on September 3, 2007, as shown in the 2010 Rules of Court, Rule 41 has been modified to reflect the mode of appeal in civil cases 10.11 In appeal by certiorari under Rule 45, the petitioner shall raise only questions of law 3. Thus, the amendment requiring a certification that the appeal involves only questions of law has been deleted.
		  
		  In civil cases brought before the Regional Trial Court or the Court of Appeals, a petition for review may be brought to the Supreme Court only where it is shown that the appellate court has committed errors or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction 12. In civil cases involving CA-G.R. SP Nos. 083571-72, there is no showing of this required jurisdictional error. A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 thus may not be properly invoked by petitioner 13.
		  
		  For corruption of public officials, prosecutors, judges and members of the judiciary, the offended party should file an administrative complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman instead of a criminal complaint with the Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Commission on Audit as held in Sangguniang Bayan of Tanauang, Batangas v. Garcillano 14. Court will not entertain civil action for damages against public officials for acts done in their official capacities and in the performance of their duties where there are other remedies provided for by the laws 15.
		  
		  However, the Court is not inclined to disqualify petitioner Cornejo as a candidate for mayor. This Court’s Constitution jurisdiction extends to petitioner Cornejo who is not a constitutional officer and who seeks to assume an office in the government. Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution reads:
		  
		  “
		- Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law. 
		  
		  Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”
		  
		  The term “any government instrumentality” used in the constitution receives a liberal construction so as to include all agencies created by law. The general rule therefore is that the judicial power of scrutiny extends not just to acts of executive but also to those of any government agency. The exception to this rule, is where the challenge is against an act of a Quasi-legislative or legislative body as defined 16.
		  
		  In the case at bar, a petition for quo warranto under Rule 66 constitutes a special civil action which is within the constitutional jurisdiction of this court, which has “the duty of the court of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”
		  
		  Under the blanket certification of the1987 Constitution and as incorporated under Section 2, Article XI, the Supreme Court has the power to review grave abuse of discretion or lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any quasi-legislative or legislative body 17. In the past, this court stressed that the power of judicial review has been extended to executive and administrative acts to determine whether such act has been made with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
		  
		  Indeed, courts can no longer remain passive and allow their constitutional override. This is truer considering the rise of many elected officials who claim privilege under the veil of immunity when accused of unseemly acts while in office. Such privilege must be brushed aside wheneverpngonng the office is being used as a sieve to the detriment of public interest. To the petitioners, we therefore stress that the power of judicial review is available to check not just executive and legislative acts, but more importantly — as in this case — topurenaiç acts of any government instrumentality. The exercise of this power is adjudged to be stronger for public bodies and even elected officials than for appointments made by the president.
		  
		  A public office is a public trust, the authority for its existence and for the powers entrusted by law on the person who commands the power to exercise it. Relations created thereby are purely personal in nature. As such, the holder of the position cannot be treated as a mere agent of the people or as a private person. Thus, said official is a person clothed with authority to perform specific public functions in the government.
		  
		  Pursuant
			- to the foregoing, we find that the petitioner has the legal standing to bring the present petition. The petitioner has alleged that he has been adversely affected by the assailed order of respondent Sangguniang Panlungsod of Makati, which directed the Makati Police to remove the petitioner’s stalls and Merchandises in the marketplace.
			  
			  The petitioner has clearly shown that he has a personal and material interest in the outcome of the case. There is therefore, a justiciable controversy. The petitioner’s allegation that the respondent Sangguniang Panlungsod acted with Grave Abuse of Discretion when it issued the assailed order, is sufficient to bestow upon him the requisite standing.
			  
			  The petitioner’s allegation that the respondent Sangguniang Panlungsod acted with Grave Abuse of Discretion when it issued the assailed order, is sufficient to bestow upon him the requisite standing.
			  
			  In the case of Araullo v. Aquino III, the Supreme Court reiterated the well-entrenched principle that the power of judicial review is vested on the Supreme Court by the Constitution. The court further held that the exercise of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercising with caution, and only when it is clear that the decision is absolutely necessary.
			  
			  The High court, after carefully considering the petition and the supporting documents, found that there is no identification of any specific law or regulation which the respondent Sangguniang Panlungsod of Makati allegedly violated when it issued the assailed order to remove the stalls in the marketplace.
			  
			  We therefore find that the instant petition has no merit.
