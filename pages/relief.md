- In *Prince Transport v. Garcia*[^2], the SC ruled that "a court can grant relief warranted by the allegations and the proof **even if it s not specifically sought by the injured party**; the inclusion of a general prayer may justify the grant of a remedy different from or together with the specific remedy sought, if the facts alleged in the complaint and ==the evidence introduced so warrant.=="
