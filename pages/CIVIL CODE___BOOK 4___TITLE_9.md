		- **ARTICLE 1784.**
			- A partnership begins from the moment of the execution of the contract, unless it is otherwise stipulated. (1679)
		- **ARTICLE 1785.**
			- When a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.
			- A continuation of the business by the partners or such of them as habitually acted therein during the term, without any settlement or liquidation of the partnership affairs, is prima facie evidence of a continuation of the partnership. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1786.**
			- Every partner is a debtor of the partnership for whatever he may have promised to contribute thereto.
			- He shall also be bound for warranty in case of eviction with regard to specific and determinate things which he may have contributed to the partnership, in the same cases and in the same manner as the vendor is bound with respect to the vendee.
			- He shall also be liable for the fruits thereof from the time they should have been delivered, without the need of any demand. (1681a)
		- **ARTICLE 1787.**
			- When the capital or a part thereof which a partner is bound to contribute consists of goods, their appraisal must be made in the manner prescribed in the contract of partnership, and in the absence of stipulation, it shall be made by experts chosen by the partners, and according to current prices, the subsequent changes thereof being for the account of the partnership. (n)
		- A**RTICLE 1788.**
			- A partner who has undertaken to contribute a sum of money and fails to do so becomes a debtor for the interest and damages from the time he should have complied with his obligation.
			- The same rule applies to any amount he may have taken from the partnership coffers, and his liability shall begin from the time he converted the amount to his own use. (1682)
		- **ARTICLE 1789.**
			- An industrial partner cannot engage in business for himself, unless the partnership expressly permits him to do so; and if he should do so, the capitalist partners may either exclude him from the firm or avail themselves of the benefits which he may have obtained in violation of this provision, with a right to damages in either case. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1790.**
			- Unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, the partners shall contribute equal shares to the capital of the partnership. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1791.**
			- If there is no agreement to the contrary, in case of an imminent loss of the business of the partnership, any partner who refuses to contribute an additional share to the capital, except an industrial partner, to save the venture, shall be obliged to sell his interest to the other partners. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1792.**
			- If a partner authorized to manage collects a demandable sum, which was owed to him in his own name, from a person who owed the partnership another sum also demandable, the sum thus collected shall be applied to the two credits in proportion to their amounts, even though he may have given a receipt for his own credit only; but should he have given it for the account of the partnership credit, the amount shall be fully applied to the latter.
			- The provisions of this article are understood to be without prejudice to the right granted to the debtor by [article 1252](((6300757a-ec39-45b7-aa0f-b3af0d0abb38))), but only if the personal credit of the partner should be more onerous to him. (1684)
		- **ARTICLE 1793.**
			- A partner who has received, in whole or in part, his share of a partnership credit, when the other partners have not collected theirs, shall be obliged, if the debtor should thereafter become insolvent, to bring to the partnership capital what he received even though he may have given receipt for his share only. (1685a)
		- **ARTICLE 1794.**
			- Every partner is responsible to the partnership for damages suffered by it through his fault, and he cannot compensate them with the profits and benefits which he may have earned for the partnership by his industry.

		- **ARTICLE 1795.**
			- The risk of specific and determinate things, which are not fungible, contributed to the partnership so that only their use and fruits may be for the common benefit, shall be borne by the partner who owns them.

		- **ARTICLE 1796.**
			- The partnership shall be responsible to every partner for the amounts he may have disbursed on behalf of the partnership and for the corresponding interest, from the time the expenses are made; it shall also answer to each partner for the obligations he may have contracted in good faith in the interest of the partnership business, and for risks in consequence of its management.

		  id:: 44432fc6-887e-446d-bff4-6092095c4046
			- The losses and profits shall be distributed in conformity with the agreement. If only the share of each partner in the profits has been agreed upon, the share of each in the losses shall be in the same proportion.

			- As for the profits, the industrial partner shall receive such share as may be just and equitable under the circumstances.
			- If besides his services he has contributed capital, he shall also receive a share in the profits in proportion to his capital. (1689a)
		- **ARTICLE 1798.**
			- If the partners have agreed to intrust to a third person the designation of the share of each one in the profits and losses, such designation may be impugned only when it is manifestly inequitable.
			- In no case may a partner who has begun to execute the decision of the third person, or who has not impugned the same within a period of three months from the time he had knowledge thereof, complain of such decision.
			- The designation of losses and profits cannot be intrusted to one of the partners. (1690)

			- If two or more partners have been intrusted with the management of the partnership without specification of their respective duties, or without a stipulation that one of them shall not act without the consent of all the others, each one may separately execute all acts of administration, but if any of them should oppose the acts of the others, the decision of the majority shall prevail.
			- In case of a tie, the matter shall be decided by the partners owning the controlling interest. (1693a)
		- **ARTICLE 1802.**
			- In case it should have been stipulated that none of the managing partners shall act without the consent of the others, the concurrence of all shall be necessary for the validity of the acts, and the absence or disability of any one of them cannot be alleged, unless there is imminent danger of grave or irreparable injury to the partnership. (1694)
		- **ARTICLE 1803.**
			- When the manner of management has not been agreed upon, the following rules shall be observed:
				- (1) All the partners shall be considered agents and whatever any one of them may do alone shall bind the partnership, without prejudice to the provisions of [article 1801](((705be2ee-88d5-43a1-8e09-0d22fd1b6c86))).
				- (2) None of the partners may, without the consent of the others, make any important alteration in the [[immovable property]] of the partnership, even if it may be useful to the partnership.

		- **ARTICLE 1804.**
			- Every partner may associate another person with him in his share, but the associate shall not be admitted into the partnership without the consent of all the other partners, even if the partner having an associate should be a manager. (1696)

		  id:: af66a272-2408-4c4a-9b9d-c5477f484248
			- A conveyance by a partner of his whole interest in the partnership does not of itself dissolve the partnership, or, as against the other partners in the absence of agreement, entitle the assignee, during the continuance of the partnership, to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or affairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership books; but it merely entitles the assignee to receive in accordance with his contract the profits to which the assigning partner would otherwise be entitled.
			- However, in case of fraud in the management of the partnership, the assignee may avail himself of the usual remedies.
			- In case of a dissolution of the partnership, the assignee is entitled to receive his assignor‚Äôs interest and may require an account from the date only of the last account agreed to by all the partners. (n)
		- **ARTICLE 1814.**
		  id:: 75027711-6d42-475a-b96f-a8b86f38e6df

			- Any stipulation against the liability laid down in the preceding article shall be void, except as among the partners. (n)

			- Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner, including the execution in the partnership name of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership of which he is a member binds the partnership, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the fact that he has no such authority.
			  id:: 630106b3-d02f-4097-ac6f-db3e297e2d08
			- An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners.
