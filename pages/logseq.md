- Logseq, as well as other PKM/Tools for Thought apps are basically if you reduce them is simply a note-taking app. You write your ideas digitally on to your smart phone or computer. Logseq, from their website, says "a privacy-first, open-source knowledge base that works on top of local plain-text Markdown and Org-mode files. Use it to write, organize and share your thoughts, keep your to-do list, and build your own digital garden."
- I used this tool this year (sometime June 2022) while using [[Obsidian]] and it stick to me since then.
- In fact, it became my daily journal app â€” from writing my TODO's, scheduled classes, habits and even tracking my health.
- It's really good.
- As one of the Youtuber/Doctor would say "What a time to be alive."
