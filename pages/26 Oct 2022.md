- Today, I just published another page, yay! Reason: Long weekend.
- Also, I appended/amended the Homepage because I've written poor English. (But there's always room for improvement. I make sure of that!)
- Anyhow, this semester is a long semester. Why?
- I enrolled [9 law subjects](((6358ccaf-c980-41f3-81bb-0babf2a97cbd))) this semester (1stSem-2022-2023). [One of them](((635e8835-4d25-4435-a866-9901202e17d4))) is not an easy subject. It does not mean some are easy-peasy by any means.

- They all demand time. Lots of hours, in fact.
- They are like your 9 kittens, 9 nine dogs, 9 little pigs however you call it. — nine (9) mistresses. They say law is a jealous mistress. That's not entirely true. but if I add "es" at the end to the word `mistress,` now that's interesting.

- May last post here was 3 months ago: to set up and get running this Github page. It's not an easy 1-2-3 setup, by the way.
- Anyway, thanks for reading. — #Adelante
