- ## PRINCIPLE:
	- Courts may exercise judicial review even when there is no direct injury to the parties involved if the legal issue at hand has transcendental importance. This means that the issue has far-reaching consequences and affects a broader public interest, including possible violations of the Constitution.
	- When interpreting statutes, particularly those using terms like "shall," courts often consider the language of the law as unambiguous and mandatory. This means that if a statute uses the word "shall," it imposes a duty that must be enforced.
	- Administrative bodies like the COMELEC should not exceed their authority by making interpretations of the law that go beyond the clear legislative intent. The principle of separation of powers requires administrative bodies to administer the law rather than interpret it in a manner that contradicts legislative intent.
- ## FACTS:
	- ### 2015
		- October 2: COMELEC issues Resolution No. 9991 prescribing guidelines for submission of SOCEs for 2016 elections, including deadline of June 8, 2016.
	- ### 2016
		- May 9: National and local elections held
		- June 8: Original deadline to file SOCEs
		- June 23: COMELEC issues Resolution No. 10147 extending deadline to June 30
		- July 7: PDP-Laban files petition questioning extension of deadline
	- ---
	- PDP-Laban argues extension exceeded COMELEC authority and violates law setting 30-day period
	  COMELEC argues 30-day period is extendible based on language and past practice
	- OSG agrees with PDP-Laban that 30-day period is mandatory
	- Peralta et al. intervene, also arguing for mandatory 30-day period
	- Case questions whether COMELEC properly exercised its authority to extend the SOCE deadline
- ## ISSUE:
	- WON the COMELEC is guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it extended the deadline for the submission of Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs)
- ## RULING:
	- The court finds that COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion when it extended the deadline for filing SOCEs and exempted candidates and political parties from administrative liabilities. This extension violates the clear language and legislative intent of the law. The court agrees with PDP-Laban and Peralta, et al. that the language of Section 14 of RA No. 7166 is unambiguous, and the required Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs) must be filed within 30 days after the elections. The court emphasizes that the term "shall" in the statute makes the filing of SOCEs mandatory.
	- ##### Legal standing
		- The court acknowledges that both PDP-Laban and Peralta, et al. have legal standing to question COMELEC Resolution No. 10147 because the legal issue involved is of transcendental importance. The matters raised in the petition and motion for intervention involve possible violations of the Constitution, specifically, the COMELEC's exercise of legislative power without proper delegation.
	- #####  Presumption of Constitutionality
		- The court refrains from discussing the constitutionality of Section 14 of RA No. 7166 in this case, as it does not constitute the core issue. The court reserves judgment on constitutional matters until the proper petition is filed between opposing parties.
	- #### In summary:
	- The COMELEC Resolution No. 10147 extending the deadline for filing SOCEs from June 8 to June 30, 2016 is declared void for violating the statutory mandate under Section 14 of RA 7166 which sets a non-extendable 30-day period.
	- However, the doctrine of operative fact is applied to recognize the effects of Resolution 10147 prior to its invalidation, since candidates acted in good faith in relying on it. Therefore, SOCEs filed by June 30 are deemed timely.
	- While judicial restraint is exercised, the concurrence notes the constitutional issues are justiciable and the Court could have ruled on the resolution's constitutionality.
	- The concurrence analyzes previous cases establishing the difference between qualifications and procedural requirements, and affirms COMELEC's authority to regulate elections procedurally. However, Resolution 10147 exceeded COMELEC's rule-making power by effectively modifying the substantive law under RA 7166, and cannot supplant or amend an act of Congress. While Resolution 10147 is invalid, its effects prior to invalidation are recognized to avoid penalizing candidates who relied on it in good faith.
- ## DOCTRINES:
	- **Doctrine of operative fact/doctrine of accomplished fact**
		- This recognizes the effects of an administrative act or law prior to its invalidation, when the public relied on it in good faith. This doctrine is applied by the court to recognize the SOCEs filed by June 30 under the invalidated COMELEC resolution.
	- **Doctrine of judicial restraint**
		- The concurrence notes the court generally exercises judicial restraint in not deciding constitutional issues if other grounds exist. However, the concurrence says this doctrine does not apply here as the issue is purely legal.
	- **Separation of powers**
		- The doctrine holds that administrative agencies cannot amend or modify acts of Congress, as that would violate the separation of powers. COMELEC is found to have exceeded its rule-making authority by effectively modifying the substantive law.
	- **Qualifications vs procedural requirements**
		- The distinction between these two concepts is discussed, with the latter allowing reasonable regulation of rights like suffrage, while the former cannot be added to without amendment.
	- **Deference to administrative agencies**
		- The concurrence cites past cases deferring to the expertise of agencies like COMELEC in implementing laws related to their mandates, like on electoral procedures.
