		- **Black's Law Dictionary:** ***Legitime*** (18c). The part of testator's property that his or her children (and occasionally other heirs) are legally entitled to regardless of the will's terms; esp., the part of a decedent's estate reserved, by law, individually to a forced heir. The legitime cannot be denied the children without legal cause.In Roman law, the amount of the legitime was one-fourth of the claimant's share on intestacy. — Also termed legal portion; legitimate portion; legitima portio; forced partition. See *forced heir.*(Scots law) [^886]

		- Under the Spanish Civil Code as well as under our Code, the legitime is defined as [[#red]]==that part of the testator’s property which he cannot dispose of because the law has reserved it for certain heirs who are, therefore, called compulsory heirs.==
		- From this definition, it is clear that a part or portion of the hereditary estate is to a certain extent withdrawn from the patrimony of the testator so that he can no longer dispose of it by any gratuitous title, although he can still enjoy it. According to Manresa, this is the distinctive nature or characteristic of the system of legitime.[^3] This limited withdrawal from the testator’s patrimony is due to the fact that the legitime is already reserved by operation of law for certain heirs who are, therefore called compulsory heirs.
			- #### Meaning of “Compulsory”
			  background-color:: blue
				- Compulsory heirs are never compelled to accept the legitime — they may accept or reject — for no one can compel another to receive a gift or an economic advantage. They are called compulsory, only because the testator cannot disregard them.

		- Thus, the Supreme Court, describing the interest which a son has in the estate of his father, once stated:
			- > “It is undeniable that a necessary or forced heir, according to the system of legitimes, has, by provision of law, **from the time of his birth, a vested right to acquire the inheritance from his ascendants after their death and such a vested right is inherent with his legitimate filiation to which belong the obligations and rights of the author of his being.** The son and the father are in some respects co-owners of the property of the latter.” ((6356de0b-45e6-418d-917e-36e8b0e5532b))

		- The system of legitime is preserved in the new Code. It is a vogue in almost all countries of Europe and Latin America. China has realized that the legitime is essential to maintain her customs and traditions. Russia, though the leading exponent of communism, nevertheless adopted a certain form of legitime in 1928. (Comment of the Code Commission).
		- Generally speaking, freedom of disposition of property is permitted only in England and in the United States of America. But in some States of the American Union, there is a certain kind of legitime for the widow. Some American and English jurists have criticized the present system in their countries and advocated the adoption of the scheme of legitime. Considering the customs and traditions of the Filipino people, and for the sake of family solidarity, the Commission decided that the legitime should be retained in the new Civil Code. Although legitime is preserved in the new Civil Code, changes are made with respect to the amounts that the compulsory heirs should receive, and illegitimate children other than acknowledged natural are made compulsory heirs. (Comments of the Code Commission).

		- The avowed purpose of the system of legitime is of course **[[#blue]]==to protect compulsory heirs.==** It is always possible that a man or a woman may forget his or her parental, filial or conjugal obligations. The law, by reserving a part or portion of the testator’s estate for the benefit of compulsory heirs, is thus able to protect such heirs from his or her anger or neglect. **To protect the children and the surviving widow or widower from the unjustified anger or thoughtlessness of the other spouse.**
		- **The system of legitimes is a limitation** upon the freedom of the testator to dispose of his property. Its purpose is to protect those heirs, for whom the testator is presumed to have an obligation to reserve certain portions of his estate, from his unjust weakness or thoughtlessness. The law was constructed in such a way that this reservation made by law is properly protected so a parent and child may not deviate so and everyone will have to comply with some particular norm.
		- A parent is expected to leave something to the children and the children who have no descendant are to leave something for their parents. It is bilateral. It is a restriction to our right to make dispositions of our property effective mortis causa.
		- ### If there are no ((635756d0-02d4-43fe-84d7-2668de85b297)), it follows that there can be no legitime.
		- **Legitime may be received from two aspects: first as a right; and second, as the property itself.** This means that when a person refers to his legitime from his father, he talks either of the right to succeed to a certain portion of the inheritance; or he may be referring to the actual property itself.
		- The testator cannot deprive his compulsory heirs of their legitime, except in cases expressly specified by law. Neither can he impose upon the same any burden, encumbrance, condition, or substitution of any whatsoever (Art. 904), except, of course, the condition that the property will not be divided for a period not exceeding 20 years.

			- Under our system of compulsory succession, the legitime of compulsory heirs may be either fixed or variable.
				- **1. Fixed:** Legitime is fixed if the amount, that is the fractional part, does not vary or change regardless of whether there are concurring compulsory heirs or not. It is fixed if the aliquot part of the testator’s estate to which a certain class of compulsory heirs is entitled by operation of law is always the same whether they survive alone or with other classes of compulsory heirs.
				- **2. Variable:** Legitime is variable if the amount changes or varies in accordance with whether compulsory heirs concur. It is variable if the aliquot part changes depending upon whether they survive alone or with other classes of compulsory heirs.
				- Thus, **the legitime of legitimate children or descendants and legitimate parents or ascendants is always one-half of the testator’s estate**, [[#green]]==while that of the other classes of compulsory heirs depends upon whether they survive as a class or they concur with other classes of compulsory heirs.==

		- As it is, the system of legitime, as adopted in the New Civil Code, is still fundamentally the same as that found in the Spanish Code. **There are, however, certain changes. Among the most important changes are the following:**
			- (a) The legitime of the surviving spouse has been converted from usufruct into full ownership.
			  collapsed:: true
				- > NOTE: The legitime of the spouse under the old Civil Code (which was a share in usufruct equivalent to the share of a legitimate child) was a right, which, of course, could be waived, but the waiver must be express. (Gamis v. Court of Appeals, L-10732, May23, 1959).
			- (b) Illegitimate children other than acknowledged natural under the Civil Code have been given a regular legitime.
				- Children of void marriages are considered natural children by legal fiction and receive the same legitime as acknowledged natural children. And other illegitimate children are each entitled to a share equal to four-fifths of that of an acknowledged natural child (Under the Family Code(Arts. [172](((634fbac2-8000-45ca-bd06-e5829cc5fb9f))), [175](((634fbac2-2bc3-4def-9ade-3b59ef5b2d99)))), however, all illegitimate children are simply referred to as illegitimate children.
				- Furthermore, the legitime of each illegitimate child is one-half the legitime of a legitimate child); and
			- (c) The mejora or betterment has been abolished, but the free portion has been increased to one-half, so that the testator may give a part or all of it to his legitimate children or descendants, or to third per- sons, subject to the rights of illegitimate children and the surviving spouse. (Comment of the Code Commission).
			- > NOTE: The classification of children and the rights of illegitimate children have been simplified and rationalized. Thus, for instance, the distinction between natural and spurious children has been eliminated.

				- Illegitimate children can now establish their filiation in the same way and on the same evidence as legitimate children.

		- (a) System of the LEGITIME (PARTIAL RESERVATION)— here, a part is for the legitime, a part is for the free portion.
		- (b) System of TOTAL RESERVATION — here, everything goes to the compulsory heirs, as long as there is at least one. Only when there is none is there freedom to dispose.
		- (c) System of TOTAL FREEDOM OF DISPOSITION — in this system, there is no legitime. Everything is free. (See4 Castan 478).

		- 1. Shortchange: Give the compulsory heir less than what he is entitled to. In this case, Article 906 shall be applicable which orders the completion of the legitime by charging against the free portion of the estate.
		  2. Omission: Omit the compulsory heir in the will; preterition. In this case, Article 854 annuls the institution of the heir and results to partial intestacy where the legitime shall be paid to the compulsory heir.
		  3. Circumvention. The best way of circumvention is to dissipate the estate by an act inter vivos making the estate so little or insignificant at the time of death. In this case, Article 1061 shall be applicable where all donations inter vivos or dispositions made during the testator’s lifetime shall be collated. The collation is done for the proper determination or computation of the legitime. In case there exists an impairment of the legitime and/or the estate becomes insufficient to pay all the shares of the compulsory heir, the donations shall be reduced to the extent that they impair the legitime of the compulsory heir.

		- The law respects the legitime so much that even donations inter vivos are to be reduced if found inofficious (that is, if they exceed the free portion) for no person may give by way of donation more than he may give by will. The donation is considered inofficious in all that it may exceed this limitation.(Art. 762). An alienation, however, which is for an onerous or valuable consideration (as a sale) would be proper since in this case, there merely is the substitution of one kind of property for another.

			- It is true that the right to enter into the possession of any inheritance commences only from the moment of the death of the predecessor-in-interest. But it is undeniable that a necessary or forced heir (compulsory heir), according to the system of legitimes, has **by provision of law, from the time of his birth, a vested right to eventually acquire the inheritance from his ascendants, the right to be actually vested, from the moment of death.** [[#green]]==Such a vested right is inherent with his filiation to which belong the obligations and rights of the author of his being.== ^{(Rocha v. Tuason and Rocha de Despujol, 39 Phil. 973).}

	- # Necessity of being “legitimate”
		- Article 992 provides a bar between the legitimate and illegitimate line of the family, thus preventing one from inheriting from the other by legal succession. The discrimination against an illegitimate child arises from his inability to inherit from the other relatives of his father and mother. Thus, an illegitimate child has successional rights only with respect to his own parents, beyond the parents, an illegitimate child has no successional rights in intestate succession. The law imposes a certain amount of discrimination with regard to illegitimate children; as if they are being condemned for something which was not of their own free volition. Even the fiction of adoption will not vest full legitimacy on the illegitimate child because the fiction of adoption produces its effect only between the adopter and the adopted.

		- When concurring with other compulsory heirs, the fractional shares are adjusted in accordance to pertinent provisions of intestate succession. The portion of the estate that does not pertain to legitime is properly termed as free disposal.

		- Succession, as a general rule, goes down the descending line. The only time when succession goes up the ascending line is when there are no children or descendants.
		- **1. Descending line:** This is the line of priority. Supposing a person has children and all of them predeceased him. Succession will go up the ascending line only upon the inapplicability of the right of representation inasmuch as the legitime of the descendant is subject to the right of representation. Each time a legitimate child or a descendant inherits, he gets half of the estate, known as the strict legitime.
		- **2. Ascending line:** Since the ascending line is not the preferred line, the right of representation does not apply to the ascending line. In cases where succession goes up, the rule is “the nearer excludes the farther”. As in the case of a legitimate child or descendant, each time an ascendant inherits, he always inherits one half of the estate considering that ascendants are considered as mere substitutes, in case there are no descendants.
