					- DE LEON
					- ‚ÄúThe chief object and purpose in construing a will is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the testator.
					- The cardinal rule of testamentary construction is to ascertain the intention of the testator and give its effect.
					- The construction of any will must be for the purpose of determining the dominant intent of the testator if the testator‚Äôs intent can be clearly perceived or ascertained, it must prevail.
					- A will is to be so interpreted as to carry out the intention of the testator.
					- A will must be construed so as to give full force and effect to the purpose of the testator, in construing a will, the courts must give effect to the intention expressed by the testator and carry out the object desired by him in disposing of his property.
					- The whole effort, in the construction of a will, is to ascertain and give the fullest possible effect to the intention of the testator.
					- Rhe court will place itself in the position of the testator, ascertain his intent from the provisions of the will, and enforce it.
					- The intention of the testator is the basic and fundamental rule in the construction of wills.
					- Rhe intent of the testator will control or govern the construction of a will.
					- The purpose of construing a will is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the testator.
					- The testator‚Äôs intent is the all-important consideration in the construction of wills.‚Äù Thus, in American decisions, the testatorial intention, or its ascertainment and effectuation, has frequently been described as the ‚Äúpolar star,‚Äù ‚Äúpolestar,‚Äù ‚Äúguiding star‚Äù or ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù of testamentary construction.
					- The rule that the testatorial intention governs in the construction of a will has been held to apply to every clause and part of the instrument. And a testator‚Äôs intention, it has been said, is necessarily his intention when the will was executed.
			- **ARTICLE 789.**
			  collapsed:: true
				- When there is an imperfect description, or when no person or property exactly answers the description, mistakes and omissions must be corrected, if the error appears from the context of the will or from extrinsic evidence, excluding the oral declarations of the testator as to his intention; and when an uncertainty arises upon the face of the will, as to the application of any of its provisions, the testator‚Äôs intention is to be ascertained from the words of the will, taking into consideration the circumstances under which it was made, excluding such oral declarations.

				- Jurado: ((632bf3a4-5d10-4eaa-b5b8-1d2d3572494d)), we can therefore say that a will perfectly valid at the time of its execution cannot be invalidated by a law enacted after the death of the testator; neither can a will totally void at the time of its execution be validated by such subsequent legislation.
