- # FROM 2019 BAR:
	- In May 2018, ABC Corp. entered into a merchandising contract which terms and conditions were totally lopsided in favor of the counterparty, XYZ, Inc. As a result, ABC Corp. suffered tremendous financial losses.
	  A year after, or in May 2019, Mr. X became a stockholder of ABC Corp. Learning about the circumstances surrounding the merchandising contract, Mr. X filed a derivative suit against ABC Corp.'s directors to claim damages on behalf of ABC Corp. due to their mismanagement. **Was Mr. X's filing of a derivative suit proper? Explain.**
		- *ANSWER 1: (My answer)*
		  No. Derivative suit is filed when a minority shareholder is a shareholder at the time of the mismanagement to the prejudice of the corporation. Here, Mr. X only becomes  stockholder one year after the tremendous financial losses of ABC Corp. as a result of lopsided contract between XYZ, Inc. Therefore, Mr. Xâ€™s filing of a derivative suit will not prosper.
		- *ANSWER 2: (Bar reviewer suggested answer)*
		  The filing of derivative suit is not proper. One of the requisites of derivative suit is that the person filing the suit must be a stockholder of the corporation at the time the acts or transactions subject of the action occurred and the time the action was filed. (Sec. 1, Rule 8, Interim Rules of Procedure for Intramural-Corporate Controversies) In the present case, the transaction subject of the derivative suit occurred when X was not yet a stockholder. In fact, X only became a stockholder one year thereafter.
	- ## AI-Assisted Critique and Grading Rubric
	- ### **ANSWER 1 CRITIQUE AND GRADE**
		- **Legal Analysis:**
		  Answer 1 correctly identifies and applies the fundamental timing requirement for derivative suits. The answer accurately states that a stockholder must hold shares at the time of the alleged wrongdoing to have standing.
		- **Strengths:**
		- **Correct conclusion**: Properly concludes the derivative suit is improper
		- **Accurate legal rule**: Correctly states the contemporaneous ownership requirement
		- **Proper factual application**: Accurately applies the timeline (contract in May 2018, X became stockholder in May 2019)
		- **Clear reasoning**: Logical progression from rule to facts to conclusion
		- **Areas for Improvement:**
		- **Lack of authority**: No citation to specific legal provisions or case law
		- **Brevity**: Could be more comprehensive in explaining the policy behind the rule
		- **Minor imprecision**: Says "will not prosper" rather than addressing standing specifically
		- **Writing Quality:**
		  The answer is concise and clear, though it contains a minor grammatical issue ("becomes stockholder" should be "became a stockholder"). The structure is logical and easy to follow.
		- **Grade: 4.25 (Good - Tier 5)**
		  *Correct conclusion and bases. Delivery is effective but may have noticeable (yet minor) flaws in communication or could benefit from more authority.*
	- ### **ANSWER 2 CRITIQUE AND GRADE**
		- **Legal Analysis:**
		  Answer 2 provides a comprehensive and authoritative analysis of the timing requirement for derivative suits. The answer demonstrates superior legal craftsmanship by citing specific procedural rules.
		- **Outstanding Strengths:**
		- **Correct conclusion**: Properly concludes the filing is not proper
		- **Precise legal authority**: Cites Section 1, Rule 8 of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intramural-Corporate Controversies
		- **Complete rule statement**: Articulates both timing requirements (at time of act AND at time of filing)
		- **Accurate factual application**: Precisely applies the timeline to the facts
		- **Professional presentation**: Uses formal legal writing style
		  
		  **Technical Excellence:**
		- **Dual timing requirement**: Correctly identifies that stockholder status is required both when the wrongdoing occurred and when suit is filed
		- **Specific citation**: Provides exact procedural rule reference
		- **Clear factual analysis**: Systematically applies law to facts
		- **Proper legal terminology**: Uses precise legal language throughout
		- **Writing Quality:**
		  The answer demonstrates excellent legal writing with proper citation format, clear organization, and professional tone. The parenthetical citation follows proper form.
		- **Grade: 4.75 (Excellent - Tier 5)**
		  *Near-perfect. Conclusion and bases are correct, with highly coherent and clear delivery, perhaps with a very minor area for improvement in elegance.*
	- ### **MODEL ANSWER**
		- **No, Mr. X's filing of a derivative suit is not proper.**
		- Under Section 1, Rule 8 of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intramural-Corporate Controversies, a stockholder filing a derivative suit must have been a stockholder both at the time the acts or transactions subject of the action occurred and at the time the action was filed.
		- Here, the alleged mismanagement occurred in May 2018 when ABC Corp. entered into the lopsided merchandising contract. However, Mr. X only became a stockholder in May 2019, one year after the wrongdoing. Since Mr. X was not a stockholder when the alleged breach of duty occurred, he lacks standing to file a derivative suit.
		- This contemporaneous ownership rule prevents "strike suits" by persons who purchase shares solely to initiate litigation and ensures that only those with genuine interest in the corporation at the time of wrongdoing may seek redress.
	- ## **FINAL ASSESSMENT**
	- Both answers reach the correct conclusion and demonstrate understanding of derivative suit requirements. However, Answer 2 significantly exceeds Answer 1 in legal authority, completeness, and professional presentation. Answer 1, while correct, reads more like a basic student response, whereas Answer 2 demonstrates the depth and precision expected of a competent lawyer. The citation to specific procedural rules in Answer 2 shows superior legal research skills and attention to authoritative sources that practicing attorneys must possess.
