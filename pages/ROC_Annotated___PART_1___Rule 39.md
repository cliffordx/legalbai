			- What can be executed in the context of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court is **a judgment or an order that disposes of the action or proceeding**.
		- It is fruit and end of the suit and aptly called the life of the law.[^3]
		- The judgment will inevitably declare that a party wins and the other party loses the litigation.
		- The judgment is not the end for the losing party because he is **afforded remedies against the adverse judgment**.

				- One has to first simply ascertain whether the judgment sought to be assailed is already final and executory. Knowing whether the judgment is final and executory is the key to unlocking the remedies afforded by the Rules of Court.
				- **Before a judgment** becomes final and executory, the aggrieved or losing party may avail of the _following remedies:_
				  id:: 62b300f4-6699-4fda-bc43-5f38fb1747c6
					- (a) Motion for reconsideration (MR);
					- (b) Motion for new trial; and
					- (c) Appeal #bar/remedial/2014
				- **After the judgment** becomes the final and executory, the losing party may avail the following:
				  id:: 62b300f4-5bc9-4f40-847a-5d723244620d
					- (a) Petition for relief from judgment;
					- (b) Action to annul a judgment;
					- (c) Petition for [[certiorari]]; and
					- (d) Collateral attack of a judgment. #bar/remedial/2014
		- When does a judgment become final and executory? #card
		  id:: 62b06803-75c7-4501-b4ec-4a684264f5f2
			- A judgment becomes executory upon the expiration of the period to appeal from a judgment or order that finally disposes  of the action or proceeding, if no appeal has been duly perfected. A judgment also becomes executory after an appeal taken from the judgment or order has been finally resolved.
			- ==Enumerated below for convenience:==
				- 1. **upon the expiration of the period to appeal from a judgment or order that finally disposes  of the action or proceeding;**
				  2. **if no appeal has been duly perfected;** and
				  3. **an appeal taken from the judgment or order has been finally resolved.**
			- On the other hand, within the period for appeal, reckoned from the notice of the judgment or final order, the said judgment or final order is not yet executory _except_ those judgments which, under the Rules, are immediately executory, like those provided for under Rule 39 ((62b0641b-0bde-4767-9bb0-0d7c6e4fe312)) Such judgment are enforceable after their rendition and shall not be stayed by an appeal taken therefrom.
			  id:: 62b0a032-8566-4fdf-ac4f-16c8f9dbfe0c
			- Thus, the remedies against a judgment would necessarily refer to those remedies:
				- (a) before a judgment becomes final and executory; and
				- (b) after the same becomes executory.
